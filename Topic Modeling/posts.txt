I feel like I gotta share this with you.

I used it for almost a week and coming from Android with almost the latest flagship processor, I don't notice any speed differences. But I noticed some animations are missing on Android, some are more beautiful and flowless. I miss some free apps, but paid on iOS. I don't mind lack of customization.

I was wondering if someone could help me with this problem. I heard that you can charge iPhone 12 with the old usb a cable but for some reason when I plug it in, nothing happens. Im confused because the cable works fine with my iPhone SE but when I plug it into the iPhone 12, nothing. If anyone has any insight into this problem I would appreciate it.

Hi everybody, do anyone else finds that piano songs sounds very distorted on your iphones? Ive tested it in my XS and my 12 pro and have the same results. The top speaker is buzzing a lot at high volumes. Its unbelievable that a 1000 bucks smartphones sounds so bad. You can test it with any piano song you like and trust me, the top speaker will be cracking at 80% of full volume

I was looking at my 12PM under a bright light and I noticed a light square in the ambient sensor area, in the middle but more towards the right side of the sensor. Can anyone else confirm that they also have that? Might get my phone looked at it if its abnormal but this is the first time I can remember seeing that since I got the phone on launch.

I got a MagSafe charger as a gift. It seems legit because it attaches strongly to my phone and the MagSafe animation would always pop up. It also seems to charge my phone just fine, no overheating so far. However, last night, with all lights turned off, I noticed that after pulling the MagSafe charger from the phone, the center of the puck is glowing faint blue. And after a few seconds, it turns red. The center keeps emitting a faint red light when not in use. 

To those who own "original" MagSafe chargers (e.g., bought from Apple directly or similar), can you verify if this really happens? I don't have the box for my charger anymore, so I have no other basis. Also, knowing whether my charger is real or fake may seem unimportant, but I'm just curious.

Hello,

I just bought an Iphone 12 and I'm new to the Apple world, used Android all my life.

As I understand the Apple TV app is supposed to be an app where I can watch the movies I put on my Iphone(via USB for example) but also a place where I can download movies for a price.

When I open the APP on my phone I can only see the movies I downloaded on the Iphone myself. Like this:



In both 'Movies' and 'Downloaded' categories I can only see the 4 movies I put in there myself.

There is no option in the app to download movies or such. What am I missing? I was expecting to see something like this when I open the app:



Thank you for reading please help me fix this.

I always write with swipe gestures and  coming from Android I thought gboard would be my best bet, but it always show "no result" when searching for gif. 

All Acces have been granted to Gboard in setting. I have also uninstall and reinstall the keyboard, but it just wont work. 

Any ideas on whats happening?

I currently have an iPhone 8 and I am going to upgrade to either a 12 or an 11 Pro, I know the 12 is newer, but the 11 pro looks so much nicer to me, I love the stainless steel design and the matte back but the 12 is newer so I'm scared the 11 pro might be outdated soon and I'm sure the 12 works better. Which one sounds better? I plan on using it for about 3 years.

iPhone 12 Pro Max and water resistance

Hi, so I had an iPhone 6 (before they introduced the water resistance) for a few years and then switched to android when apple dropped it from iOS updates. I picked up an iPhone 12 Pro Max in December and was curious about its water resistance. I understand that its water resistant and not waterproof, however what are the chances of it dying on the first time putting it in water? I know that its not covered by warranty and I do not have the money to buy another one. Does salt water / chlorine break the seal? Any other advice? Just curious as I do a lot of water sports. Thanks.

 Hello I currently lost my phone and looking to replace it, I found a great deal on an iPhone XR refurb from apple for $475 128gb with new battery. Or do I go for a new iPhone 12 128gb which would be $880 outright.

My previous phone was an iPhone 11 Im just worried the Xr is a downgrade but thought it might hold me over until the 13 or just go for the 12 and keep it for a few years.

Just looking for some input I think Im leaning towards the XR...

Should I pick the 12 mini or the regular 12? I'm coming from a OP 6T and I'm upgrading mainly due to the great cameras on the 12.

I do however play COD mobile on my phone and I'm thinking maybe playing would be an issue due to the smaller screen size of the mini. I've got pretty decently sized hands btw. Can easily hold a volleyball one handed but not quite a basketball Ball.

Thank you 12 mini user guys!!!

My iPhone 12 sometimes loses internet even if it's connected to wifi but comes back on once I turn the wifi on and off on my phone.

I'm not sure if this is an issue with my internet connection because the same thing happens on my iPhone 6s Plus before I changed phones.

My macbook and other devices connected to wifi doesn't seem to be affected though.

Do you guys also experience this?

So last night I bought a MagSafe charger for my IPhone 12 Pro, not thinking about how my case would work with it. I have a Spartan case made by Poetic Cases (Ill drop the link below) which claims to be military grade drop tested and is shockproof/drop-proof/import resistant/scratch-proof, all with having a built in retractable kickstand and screen protector. All of this is necessary because Im a clumsy oaf when it comes to my phone.

My issue is the back panel is too thick for the MagSafe to work properly with the case attached to the phone as the kickstand is embedded in the space that the MagSafe charger attaches to the phone. The company who makes the case I currently have also make cases compatible with MagSafe however they are missing one key component that I really enjoy with my case: a retractable kickstand.

Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations for a case that would suit my needs? Ie a good sturdy phone case with a kickstand that is MagSafe friendly. I really appreciate the help, thank you all in advance

For those of you interested here is a link to the case I currently am using: https://www.poeticcases.com/collections/2020-apple-iphone-12-case/products/spartan-2020-apple-iphone-12-12-pro-case?variant=33104596402253

Im planning to get an iPhone 12 Pro and im not sure if i should get it in 128GB or 256GB. 

Currently, Im using an iPhone 11 with 64GB and I have to consistently delete my photos and apps to make sure I have some extra space. My storage space now is at 53.2GB/64GB used. 

Is anyone using a 256GB iPhone and feels that the storage space is too much? Or do you think that more storage space is always better?

Hello! I am strongly thinking about switching to Iph12, I'm looking for a deal now. I have experienced IOS every now and then by flipping phones and I am sure I love it. 

The problem is (and I would like some help) that I love some of the unorthodox apps from android like cracked ones or youtube vanced which is amazing for media and time consuming.

Besides youtube premium, are there any ways to have something like Vanced?
I know there are cracked or ++ apps for IOS too, but they get unauthorized or just don't work.

Recently my 11 has been glitching, throughly pissing me off, it has some cracks in it from the past year of my accidentally dropping it and not using the right case. I got in late May 2020 and its at 90% battery. Some of the scratches got on to the front camera so that reduces the quality. Other than that, I do enjoy the 11 but its just randomly glitchy and the camera quality is reduced due to the scratches.

Hello guys, I know many of us hate the subject, but I am struggling with something couple of months and have no decision yet. The time has come.

Should I switched to iPhone 12? My GF is trying to make me buy the 12, after switching from Android to 11 Pro.  What is stopping me is the old-fashioned hardware which the iPhone has. I can get 120 + Hz display for less money and I will probably get more features. 

And I'm kinda guy who like to personalize things. Or maybe I just cant image I won't be able to. You know you are missing the things you don't have. I am sometimes using my phone to connect to Raspberry Pi machine. I love the new design. I am afraid I will miss the features current Android phone has.

So, Im looking at storage sizes and normally I would be willing to get the highest GB capacities but I looked at my storage usage and Im currently using 44 of 256GB!! 

When I get this new phone, I should definitely get at most a 128GB phone, right?

Hey, i am wondering if i can stick Magsafe charger on magnetic mount by simply sticking a metal plate under Magsafe charger and mount on existing magnetic mount

Do you think it will hold as strong as a Magsafe car holder with ball mount?

I have heard the magnetic mount could weaken Magsafe's magnet itself, then it will hold less stronger

Also some users may encounter charging issues (it didnt actually charge despite of having charging animation)

Thanks

Hi all, I just upgraded to an iPhone 12 and I'm noticing some issues with my phone: FaceTime audio cuts out repeatedly, and I don't receive push notifications/sounds when I get a text, snapchat, instagram message etc even though my phone isn't on silent.

&amp;#x200B;

is there a solution for these issues? feeling frustrated I "upgraded" only to get a worse phone.
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-03-04
Do you think apple will put a 120Hz (or higher refresh rate) display only in next years Pro models or also in the regular iPhone 13 (and eventually 13 mini)?
Unfortunately I can see them using this new feature as the major difference between regular models and Pro models, just like theyve been doing up until the iPhone 11 that had an LCD screen while the 11 Pro had the OLED screen. In fact, in my opinion, this years iPhone 12 Pro doesnt have much more value to it than the regular 12 to justify the price difference.

Just my thought, and Id like to know your point of view on the matter.

Hey!

Is there any presumptions when Apple will start selling refurbished iPhone 12? Will it appear on the "Refurbished" section after the new iPhone batch will be released in the fall or it can happen before that? Looking for an upgrade from my iPhone 7. I was looking on getting the iPhone 11, however I didn't like that it uses and LCD and because of it it doesn't look like a future-proof device compared to the iPhone 12. However current price of the 12 is a bit too much for my pocket, that's why I'm wondering whether to grab an 11 or wait till the 12 appears under the "Refurbished" section so I could save some $ dollars and get it cheaper. What do you guys think?

Short review: it fits excellently, the magsafe is just as good as with case off, the buttons are clicky, the case has good grip, and I love being able to attach a wrist strap, which will loop in either on left or right side. The cam-lock mount is solid, though you will only be able to mount a lens over the regular wide camera, not the ultrawide (the Pro mount allows mounting over regular wide and built-in tele). It also seems like it will protect the phone from minor falls, though the rubber on their non-thin cases seems a bit more protective. 

These have been on pre-order while they manufacture them, so I had bought a non-magsafe thin case in the meantime, which I ended up returning. A little background: I have been using Moment cases for my last three phones (Pixel 2, Galaxy Note 9, Galaxy S10e). Until now the choices were the wooden back or the black canvas. Not wanting to deal with the dirt that might collect in the canvas, I always went with wood, even though I never loved the aesthetic.  

So I was excited to have more options this time around with their new thin cases. But the non-magsafe thin case I got, in green, never fit quite right; the phone always felt like it was about to pop out of the case, even when I took the screen protector and back glass protector off. This seems like a somewhat common occurance with 12 cases in general but this case in particular. 

All this to say that my new moment thin case with magsafe (in blue) is perfect, I wholeheartedly recommend it, and if anyone doesn't care about magsafe and doesn't want to shell out the extra $10, I'd say it's worth it to do it anyway just for the boost in quality these newly-manufactured versions have. 

AMA, and I'm happy to provide pictures as well.

Is it just me, or does the 12 Pro Max have some WiFi connectivity issues? I recently upgraded from an iPhone X (which had no issues) and Ive found that its taking forever to play videos, load webpages, and browse Reddit.

Im fairly confident that its not my internet because all my other devices (MacBook, PC, etc.) all run perfectly fine, but my Pro Max struggles.

Is this a known issue or is my brand new phone faulty? Are there any fixes that will improve the phones WiFi connection? Any suggestions/solutions would be greatly appreciated!

EDIT: Thanks for all the great feedback! I restarted my phone and reset the network settings and it seemed to make it a lot better. I will definitely keep all the other feedback, suggestions, and solutions noted for the future if the WiFi ever starts acting up again

How do you guys justify yearly upgrading to a new iPhone? 
If you have an 11, you know you dont require a 12 to live. However, you like the new features, so you get it anyway!

I love upgrading my phone annually, but for some reason I dont see myself upgrading my Mac or Apple Watch, iPad as often. Weird eh? And recently, Ive been asking myself if I really NEED to do this... I know its not a good financial decision, but I love the new iPhones.

So in a weird turn of events, my iPhone 12 decided to show the message that my battery is not genuine, 1 and half months after buying it brand new. I bought it from Amazon Germany. More importantly, it somehow keeps restarting every 5 to 10 minutes. 

I think this must be some hardware issue, because it is pretty strange that it took more than a month to show this error. Anyone else has experienced this ?

Hey everyone, pretty new here. I'm getting my first ever iPhone after a very long while (my last iphone was the 4S) never been into having high-end smartphones and i've been sticking around to very bad phones recently. Finally done with this agonizing pain and i have an iPhone 12 Pro Max arriving on tuesday! I'm really, really excited about this but have some concerns and questions, I'd really appreciate any kind of help here.

The first issue is the green/yellow tint lottery, I've been seeing a lot of commentary on this but I can't tell much based on just the videos i see over the internet. Actually how noticeable is this issue in real life, and how likely am i to get a phone with this issue? Also, can it be fixed with a software update?

The other thing is international warranty. The phone is coming overseas (bought it from the US) and it seems i get a 1 year international warranty, but let's just say apple takes my phone for whatever problem to give me a new one, AFAIK i can't get a replacement phone in my country and my new phone has to come from USA. I don't know how true this is but i've seen people saying they have waited more than 6 months for a replacement. Any experiences?

I'd also love to hear some iphone tips, camera-or-general settings recommendations and some commentary on the size of the iphone 12 pro max... Thanks!

Hi I am looking to use the iPhone 12 as an action cam for snowboarding...is anyone aware of a selfie stick that holds it securely enough for this purpose, also I would love to find a secure way to mount it to gopro style mount so maybe a case with a mount or similar system.open to all suggestions...thank you.

The idea for all this is I was thinking to buy an action cam but that would set me back $600 and need also new phone as my pixel is now 3 generations back so was thinking to just get the iPhone 12 as its video is as good if not better and stabilization is also very close to gopro 9.

So I know Apple had screwed up the wireless charging for these and apparently iOS 14.3 had fixed that. I have now updated to 14.4 and my wireless issues never stopped, but they have gotten worse.

I have to restart my phone every night before bed to ensure that my wireless charging works. If I forget, and I put it on the charger, it doesn't work and I wake up to 2% battery life.

Does anyone else have this issue? Since it's apparently "Fixed" by Apple I'm wondering if I should warranty swap my phone.

The cable that came with my phone kept disconnecting randomly when I was charging my phone, like when you move it around a bit... it was an Apple cable, I also have an Anker cable which I connected and it works fine, so I contacted Apple to request a new cable, came in the post today, exactly the same issue as the other Apple cable! Disconnects from the phone when charging if you move it slightly!

Anyone else having these issues? Ive had it on 2/2 Apple cables but my Anker cable is fine!

Im coming from the note 8, the main reason I'm switching is because i have to charge 2 to 3 times to get 7+ hours SOT and also it just gotten so slow. I considered Iphone because that my friend has the X and it is also released in 2017, it is still so freaking fast and still has updates while mine has stopped a year ago. Though I'm not sure about the oneplus's software and the smoothness of the 120hz on the oneplus is making it hard to decide. Note i have a macbook air m1 a month ago. What are the benefits of having the iphone and a macbook? How well do they work together?

Im thinking about getting an iPhone 12 but have held off waiting on a fix or apple responding to what the problem is.  The green blacks and yellow whites is something I dont want to deal with and I know if I get one like that Ill just return it for a refund.  Ive read during pandemic it was hard getting consistent good raw materials for displays and wondering now that production is more normal are the newer displays be a better shot at getting a phone with a normal trouble free display.

I've got "brand new iPhone 12" from my loved one, but I can see glue between glass and aluminum on the back of the phone. I don't trust him, cause this phone came without plastic (in new iPhone's paper?) sticker on the front, or back of the phone. He told me that he bought this phone locally from the shop. I will add, that he waited extra time (4 days), because "they didn't have my color" (they did, when I checked their website). I know that you can attach something directly to phone battery, GPS localizer, microphone or something else, can anyone help me with that? Can I check somehow if he is spying on me, or is just a defect?

thinking about getting the iPhone 12 coming from a Galaxy s10e. I'm debating whether I should purchase an unlocked phone from apple directly or buy from tmobile (my carrier). I want my phone to be able to connect with any carrier in the future, but I read that iphones from tmobile only have GSM capabilities and will not work with CDMA carriers.

So my questions are, do all unlocked iphones purchased from apple work with all network types? (CDMA, GSM)? If i travel to other countries will my phone be compatible with their carriers too? And do I just take my sim card out from my Samsung and put it in the iPhone? Thanks in advance!

I had this problem where all of my custom non-Apple apps would go to *Other,* without being sorted in different sections like Creativity, Social, Games, etc. I was very frustrated, looking for solutions online, and I didn't find anything. Then I had to install a new app, and it automatically fixed everything for me - Twitch is in Creativity, Instagram in Social, Duolingo in Education.

Just sharing if anyone else comes across this weird bug.

My birthday is coming up soon, and I want to but a new phone (currently have an iPhone XR). Which of the iPhones that are listed in the title of this post would be more worth my money/time buying? 

If this helps for your answers, here is what I may use it for:

\- Watching Netflix on the go

\- Watching football (soccer) matches on the go

\- Playing video games

\- Taking photos (high quality ofc)

\- The staples (text, sms, calls, FaceTime, etc)

Also, should I buy a case from Apple, or from other companies (otterbox for example)?

Thanks for the advice guys!

Ive had the X since April 2018. It has served me well but in recent months Ive started feeling the pinch of its aging performance. It takes just enough more time to launch apps for me to notice. It also sometimes doesnt register taps or takes long to do things it used to do quickly like open the share sheet and send Reddit replies for example(it feels like an unregistered tap). Also apps close way too much in the background. Relaunching these apps is very annoying since it cant hold many apps in memory.

Its getting annoying. I was hoping to wait till the 13 comes out but I dont know if I can persevere that long. 

For guys who got the 12/12 Pro...will the 12/12 Pro solve these issues for me? Or is the performance gap minimal?

Hello! 

I am thinking of buying the the official Apple leather case for my iPhone 12 Pro in pacific blue. I was thinking of getting the baltic blue leather case but wanted to hear from someone who already owns one. I specifically want to know how the blue case ages and how it looks after a few months of use/wear. 

Do the cases look good after the leather has started to wear? 

TIA.

Hi everyone, I got a 12 Pro yesterday and I am experiencing issues with the camera, the camera becomes laggy when i'm not in direct light. Even slightly dimmer light makes the camera quality look terrible, blurry and smudgy. My iPhone X pictures looked a ton better and clear with the same lighting. From the research I've done it seems a lot of people are experiencing this and it might just be normal for this camera (which sucks). Unfortunately I don't always have good lighting in the pics and videos I take so this isn't going to work well for me, I need a camera that doesn't have this issue.

I was wondering if the regular 12 has this same problem? Even better, is every 12 Pro like this? I've talked to a couple people who have no issues with their cameras. Could mine just be defective?
-------------------------------

I really like all the features of iPhone 12 compared to the iPhone 11 (specially the size since I have short-ish fingers) but I have seen on the internet that the battery is pretty bad.

According to Screen Time I use my phone 4-5 hours a day on average. Mostly Instagram, web browsing (newspapers), WhatsApp and YouTube.

What are your experiences so far? How is it compared to previous iPhones? If you can barely hit the end of the day then in some months once the battery's health starts dropping it won't reach that point so I'm skeptical.

I have an iPhone 8 with 80% of battery health and it's really really bad.

Hello, I was looking at an iPhone 12 and wanted to go for the physical dual sim version due to obvious dual sim carrying. I do know of the problem with 5g only working when one sim is active and that is acceptable enough. However, I had heard from some users claiming they had issues with signals dropping in countries like the US or UK but I thought that could be just some faulty devices so I wanted to ask if that was true.

Also, if the physical dual sim iPhones will cause any other problems when used outside of Hong Kong as they are made for Hong Kong. 

Thanks in advance.

Hey everyone I have had my iPhone 12 blue since a day or two after it came out and something caught my eye this morning. 

Under the charging port the blue colouring is chipping away and turning silver. ([heres a photo of the colour chipping ](https://imgur.com/gallery/xD40nJ4))I always gently plug my phone in so I dont know how this could be happening. You can only see it with good lighting. 

This is really frustrating because I always have a case on my phone so I dont get how its rubbing off so easily. 

Thanks for any responses

I think I will be returning the silicone case, it's still within the return period (bought from amazon) and if I manage to I would want to switch to a different case but I need the magsafe compatibility. I know a lot of you would suggest to try the leather one, but that doesn't have the microfiber lining on the sides and I am afraid it'll scratch the shiny sides of my iPhone quite easily compared to the silicone one (I also remove the case kinda daily). I considered the clear case from Mous (I do not care if the case is clear or not) but after checking on youtube its magsafe compatibility is not great, it doesn't stick as tightly as the apple's own cases do. You might say the mous case doesn't have the microfibre lining anywhere on the clear variant, well true but with clear cases you can easily see if there are dust particles.  Any other suggestions?

Im zero for two when it comes to screen protectors. Ive tried two different Otterbox Trusted Glass screen protectors that I found at Target. While they had that handy tool to help you apply the screen protector in the box, both times dust from the box was captured under the glass in the bottom corner, and with the second screen protector, the top corner by the Face ID camera wouldnt lay flat, resulting in an air bubble. The sides are also very prone to chipping. Does anyone have a suggestion for an easy to apply/foolproof screen protector that wont trigger my OCD?

Got an iPhone 12 Pro Max on February 11th, was able to reboot it with no problem, then suddenly I cant turn it back on without plugging it in. The battery isnt dead and the apple logo flashes across the screen then it goes black. I took it back to the store got a new one and it worked fine, went home plugged it in that night woke up to same issue, I realized that it might be the Anker charger I got off Amazon.

I dont understand why everyone loves fast charging so much... I use it sometimes when Im in a jam and I need to keep my phone on but other than that I use my old charger over night and its good for the whole day on heavy use. Anyway the fast charging isnt good for the battery, it will cause the battery health to go down faster no? I used fast charging a couple times when I got my iPhone 12 at first and it went to 99% in a month, now Ive been using regular charging speeds and my slow MagSafe charger and it hasnt gone down in 3 months. Whats the appeal whens most people charge there phone overnight?

I'm hesitating a lot between the iPhone 12 and the iPhone 12 Pro. I was leaning towards the 12 Pro because of the telephoto lens (I do quite a lot of pictures and often zoom in and I currently have a phone without one and the pictures are just terrible whenever I digitally zoom in) and the night mode also as the places I take pictures in aren't always decently brightened. 

I would want to go for the 256 gb model and so there is a 200$ difference between the two models, which I can afford but is still to take under consideration. Also, I do plan on keeping the phone for longer than 2 years, so the 4 gb ram made me worry a little.

And lastly, the weight is A BIG factor for me. I dislike heavy phones (or phones that feel heavy). I currently have a Huawei and although is weighs 174g it doesn't FEEL that heavy (it's a bit bigger in screen size than the iPhones 12 so hopefully that would help with the weight of it), but I have read several reviews mentioning that the weight of the Pro was a dealbreaker.

So please enlighten me! :) Thank you!

Good evening, I just wanted to know about 2 things Ive noticed with my phone, the first thing Ive noticed is the screen brightness is not as strong as the previous Iphones and the second thing is mostly in the black backgrounds If I see closely theres is moment when the screen is bright black like a white tone contrast and then suddenly gets darker like a kind of flickerin, Im sorry if Im not explaining myself the right way, to make the story short is bright and then gets dark, I saw in macrumors this is known issue with the green tint screen and flickering issue and according to apple it could be fix soon with an update, I just wanted to hear about your experience due to my phone still under warranty.

I got an iPhone 12 last week and the experience of iOS working seamlessly with my Watch has been nothing short of magical. It has clearly proven to me that not everything works and has to be present on iOS but whatever is works perfectly without you even noticing it.

But there has been one hiccup that is wanting me to get rid of my first iOS device. FAST CHARGING. 
Is it that iPhone users are used to the heat when charging at 20W or is it just me being spoilt because the Android counterparts with Dash Charging have it sorted?

Like this has been my single most quirk and I am not being able to wonder as I read through subs and forums and videos. And there are thousands like me. So is it acceptable for the device to heat up while fast charging on iPhones. I am even thinking of returning my device now but many have told me that it is fine until that message on the screen. The phone is not burning hot but it is not comfortable to hold either or take calls.

I wonder how Apple still has not sorted this which is almost non exist with companies like OnePlus (my prev device)

From tech support to Apple forums I have seen so so many users saying their brand new phones heat up. Like is this taken for granted for iOS devices?

What do you think of the quality of the touchscreen?
Pls don't tell me it's a flagship blabla; i'd like to hear from everyone especially from people coming from android.
Iphone 12 it's my firsy iphone ever but in comparison to my old honor 9, touchscreen here seems "sleepy" sometimes; or especially in certain apps (google made) it seems to miss or to ignore my touch. It never stops to work or freeze; it seeme only disappointing if i consider the price i paid for this phone.
Just my humble opinion

I had an iPhone 7 Plus. Used it for over 3 years until, due to continuous drops and mishandling, most of its hardware did not work properly. I wanted to upgrade to an iPhone, but the notch seemed like the ugliest thing on a display. 

So I bought a Samsung A50s and used it for about 1.5 years(I thought, temporarily till Apple fixes their notch) till it died on me a couple of days ago. So I got an iPhone 12. I stared clicking a lot of pics as soon as I got the phone out. Now the A50s is a mid ranger. It clicked decent pics for its price. There were times when it could not keep up(low light usually) but for 350 dollars I could not complain. Now the iPhone pics are good. But they are not that good from a 2 year old 350 dollar phone. 

The worst part is the front camera pictures. No matter who the subject is, if the lighting is not perfect/outdoors, the pictures are straight ugly. 

Now before you say iPhone pics are more detailed/realistic, looking at the subjects IRL and then looking at the pics seems to differ a lot.

I have opted for the Otterbox Strada in the end but was hoping to be able to find a MagSafe case that I could get for the car cradle. 

Does anyone know of one. I get the flappy cover would get in the way when folded back which I assume is why there isnt one. But I really want something over the screen for when I shove my phone in my pocket and still have the protection of a case in case something happens while using my phone. 

Im hoping the MagSafe will still work through the case.

I recently upgraded from 6s+ to the 12, and I expected everything to be a massive upgrade. Audio wise, I was surprised that it wasn't the case. First I lost the headphone jack ( expected and known for many years ) then I tested the speakers with an MKBHD video. I was quite shocked when the mono-speaker setup on the 6s+ actually sounded clearer and more pleasing to the ears than the 12. While the 12's speakers are stereo and much louder, they...sound like trash, for lack of a better term. The only way for me to somewhat enjoy music on the 12 is at 50% volume or less, anything above is just unbearably bad. Is it just my iPhone 12 ? It made me appreciate the "underwhelming mono-speaker setup" on the 6s+ and that is something that should NOT happen.

Hey guys, Ive recently started experiencing the green tint on my 12. I noticed it wasnt there before but it recently started happening faintly at the top of my screen at below 50% brightness, however Its not severe enough for me to ask for a replacement and I wouldnt want to risk getting an even more defective phone lol. I just wanted to know is there any chance of it being fixed in the iOS 14.5 update?

iPhone 12 Pro Video Playback Issue

Hello,

Im not sure this is the correct subreddit for this, so forgive me if Im in the wrong place.

I upgraded to the iPhone 12 Pro this week. I regularly film videos on my phone, Airdrop them to my MacBook for editing, then Airdrop them back to the phone for posting on social media. Using the 12 Pro, and the same workflow Ive used countless times on my iPhone X, Im having an issue where the edited videos do not play on the phone. Audio plays fine, but the video freezes on a single frame or two. I havent yet turned in the X, so I tried Airdropping the same video to it as a test, and it plays fine. Ive tried different formats and codecs, always the same result. Has anyone else seen this issue or have any insight they can offer me?

Thanks

So I upgraded from an iPhone 6s+ to the iPhone 12. Since I use a Windows PC, the whole changing backup location to external drive using Powershell and CMD thing seems pretty complicated and most Youtubers recommend using the wireless data transfer option to setup the new iPhone. While photos and apps will all be transferred to the new iPhone, I wonder if in-app data will also be transferred ? To be more specific, I have an app called Aloha, its a private browser which has an option for you to store files downloaded from the internet. Im sure that the app itself will be transferred to iPhone 12, but what about the files within the app ?

On a side note, how long will the data transfer process take if Im transferring ~128GB of files wirelessly ?

I have an iphone 11 and really like it a lot but have been wanting a smaller phone because the 11 is heavy and the smaller size of the mini looks appealing. Battery is important to me but i get some hand pains from the 11. I use my phone quite a lot but I mainly just web browse, use reddit, podcasts, music and some youtube.   I have 84% battery health on the 11 but I could get a new battery free or switch to the 12 mini.

Should i get a new battery for 11 and wait for the 13 line or switch to a mini?

From my first Motorola to my first Nexus and then my first Samsung. I am finally leaving android, 8 devices &amp; 17 years later.

Android is a great operating system and ever improving with great versatility but unfortunately the hardware is slowly going in the wrong direction for android.

Manufacturers are trying to cut cost and push profit by offering mid-high range phones that all seem to have atleast one downfall, there no longer seems to be an all round solid android device and the obsession with forcing people to own 6.7 inch phablets is beyond me.

iPhones hardware have always impressed me but iOS was always.. meh.. but with the release of iOS 14 I feel like I can finally have apple hardware with a slightly closer to android experience. (Minus the bugs lol)

I have just ordered the iphone12 mini in my favourite colour red!

Does anyone have any suggestions or advice moving to Apple from Android after so long?

Hi,

I noticed this issue when taking screenshots. Most of the times, when I try to share it from the screenshot preview, it just freezes. I have to lock the iPhone and unlock it, so that the screen can work again.

Sometimes it also takes a really long time for taking the screenshot, I mean before you actually see it it takes even 30 seconds or it doesnt work at all.

Same issue applies when Im on Facebook or Safari and I try to share a webpage or an article. Once safari literally froze, even quitting the app didnt solve the problem.

So I  tried to turn the iPhone off and back on, it kinda worked, but it doesnt seem to fix the problem. I also updated it.

When I first bought it, that happened maybe once or twice a month but now its literally at least once a day.

What could be the issue?

Ive decided to swap my case and MagSafe charger for an Apple Watch. I was thinking about selling my MagSafe charger for ages and if thats going then the case might aswell go too. 

My MagSafe was originally next to my bed but with having a 10 month old, the metal banging on the table always woke her up so I decided to take it downstairs and connect it to my ps5. 

Whenever Im gaming I think I might aswell use slow charge so end up just shoving a cable into the console and also have the fast charger next to me in the plug so the MagSafe was never getting used. 

I only bought the official case because I thought it would be Best with MagSafe but now thats going I cant argue keeping a 50 case when I can get a very similar one on Amazon just without the logo for 10. Also I can trade in the case and get around 30 for my watch. 


What do you think? Is this a good idea? Do you use the MagSafe or have the care?

Hi Everyone!

I purchased my new iPhone 12 64gb about 3 weeks ago.

Upon opening it, and *until iOS 14.4 was released and installed*, I was able to *use my phone for 2 days straight without needing to charge it.*

*After installing 14.4 last week*, I get at most *6 to 8 hours of use* and standby before it dies.

Disabling background app refresh, turning off 5G and keeping the brightness down makes no difference.

My battery is still at 100% capacity and the safe charging function has always been enabled.

*Here's the TLDR:*

**Before 14.4 update**

* All default features **enabled**: 2-3 days before empty

**After 14.4 update**

* All default features **enabled**: 6-8 hours max before empty
* All default features **disabled**: 6-8 hours max before empty

**What hasn't fixed anything**

Reset all content and settings in Settings

Enter DFU mode and restore to fresh IPSW

Disabling every system service

Contacting Apple Support and running diagnostics

**Conclusion:**

iOS 14.4 has killed mine (*and many others'* battery life.)

**Please do not comment on this post with pointless things including:**

* ***"restart your iPhone"***
* ***"View this link to a support page"***
* "**Restore your iPhone"**
* **"Disable these features/services"**

**If you do not know the answer to this problem, DO NOT REPLY!!**

When I look at a black screen with screen brightness all the way down in a dark room at night I can see greenish tint. This is also noticeable when I get to settings or darkmode app - grey appears greenish.

Also, the screen flickers once when I switch between some apps. Not sure if this is a major issue? 

- Is doing computer factory reset bad on your phone? 

I rather not bother to visit Genius Bar if chance of then replacement the phone to brand new once is low.

- Did everyone else with issue get a replacement or was pushed back and told to wait for software update? 

- Should I just get apple care so future software hardware issues are covered after 1 year?

I have a new iPhone 12, until a few days ago everything was working perfectly, but (i assume since I downloaded 14.4) every single wired Apple accessory i have at home (charging cable -new and old, lightning headphones, lightning-headphone jack adapter) is currently not recognised by the phone. When i plug it in nothing happens.
I have a knockoff charging cable that works for both charging and data transfer but its incredibly slow. 
On r/iphonex i saw someone reinstalling their SIM card when having a battery issue, I tried the same thing and when I plugged it in the phone was charging the first time that I plugged it in.
The same chargers/accessories work on my old iPhone 6 and this iPhones port is completely clean. Im guessing its a software issue.

I don't think apple will go with a smart battery case like it did with previous generations, instead it'll implement the external battery as an accessory ..but I'm just wondering around what time of the year can this be expected?

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, why is no other reputable brand creating something similar? Anker, spigen etc? The only ones using this concept seem to be brands that I have never heard of and when it comes to battery I rather not risk it going with an unknown brand and then have the battery accidentally explode ..I am happy to wait for some known brands to come out with their own version of the product, just wondering whats taking them so long

I am not a physicist but just curious, can magnets actually get weak over time?  
On the CMS Magnetics page it states: "Several factors **can** weaken the **magnetism** in a **magnet**. If a **magnet** is stored close to heat, strong electrical currents, other **magnets**, or radiation, it **can** lose its strength. Additionally, high humidity **can** corrode neodymium **magnets".**  


I'd like to focus on 'several factors can weaken ...other magnets'. So say for instance, when I have stopped charging I leave my iPhone 12 and the MagSafe charger next to each other but not attached .. so they are not 'stuck' onto each other, but they are in the vicinity of each other. There is some sort of magnetic attraction between them because they are close to each other on the same table, but not close enough to pull each other and stick together. Now, is this damaging/weakening the magnets in my iPhone or the MagSafe charger? Very weird question, but it is curiosity so if anyone has some more info on this I'd be happy to listen to it.

I switched to the 12 Pro Max from an Android (Motorola e5 Supra) and for the first few days I didnt notice any problems or uncomfort; I wasnt paying enough attention. I liked the large screen (I watch a lot of videos on my phone) and the camera was novel. The change wasnt too extremely drastic since I already had one large phone. Then I read all the comments from people here and elsewhere about all the issues they have with the size/weight. Things like one-handed use, wrist/thumb/pinky pain, and how switching (most commonly) to the 12 Pro was so much better for them. Because Im an idiot who cant ignore other peoples opinions, now I dont know how much Ill notice these things in my daily use or how much Ill care, and Im on the fence of whether or not to return mine and make that switch. People who have 12 PMs, are you bothered by these things? I just want to make sure this isnt a case of the grass is always greener and Im not running the risk of being dissatisfied with a smaller model should I switch.

So i saw somebody post a picture of his 12 mini with peeled off color from around the lenses but now got deleted. I saw some other people say that its common in iPhone12.

I would like to hear your thoughts and if you had the same problems right to me when that happened. Thank you guys in advance !

I heard magnets get weak overtime, would placing the iPhone next to the MagSafe charger on the table (close, but not attached to each other) overnight weaken the magnets?

I have many issues on my screen:

- Screen auto scrolls up when Im using apps with scroll features such as Instagram, Reddit, stock apps.

- Screen flickers when I move between different apps

- Did the black screen test and my screen flicks grey/green when I have a black screen on in a dark room


* What is the best way to a get replacement fast?

Genius bar or support chat? Also, some of the issues are hard to replicant since it happens at random times. So Im worried genius bar will just tell me to wait for next software update or reboot phone.

Also, Do you think I can get a brand new phone as a replacement and not refurbished since my phone is only a month old?

2. Coming from a Pixel 2 and an iPhone 11, the battery performance is hugely underwhelming- is this normal or will it improve gradually?

3. When driving around, is it safe to connect it to my car via USB for Apple CarPlay? The phone gets a bit too warm too quickly for my liking

4. Sometimes when I exit a music/sound/call situation, the volume and ringer indicator flashes for a brief while - is this a bug or is it a feature?

We have tried restarting the modem/router. At my uncles house however, the wifi is the only thing that does want to work. Now we do have a bit weaker data signal there but not really enough to cause these issues. Mine will work on both for instance at my uncles. Sometimes at home I have to toggle my wifi for it to work no big deal. But she has tried that also to no avail. Any suggestions greatly appreciated!!!

Update: turned the cellular data from lte to 5g on and everything seems to be working fine!

Only had my 12 pro max a couple of days and like discussions on these articles, found the overall WiFi speeds were far lower than other devices.

However the tips to turn off system location services worked a treat as in WiFi speeds were comparable to other devices!

Its a great machine (had iPhone 8 before), but sometimes i have the same problem i had with the older iPhone 8, which certain apps (mainly social apps, Reddit included sometimes) reboot themselves or refresh the home page unannounced if I switch to other apps or turn the screen off. The background refresh is on on all of those apps, so Im really clueless on what to do. 

Thanks for all the helpers!

Has anyone use Supcase EXO Pro or Unicorn Bettle Pro and removed the flimsy screen protector?

Is it gonna scratch your phone? 

I have a Belkin screen protector but it wasnt fully covering the bezel part of the case. Just scared that its going to scratch the side of the phone.

Hello! Do you know any applications that would help improve my iphone 12 portrait shots? I upgraded from an iphone X and I must say that there is a big difference between the portrait shots of the two devices. Ive just recently learned to adjust the aperture when taking portrait shots on iphone 12, but it doesnt have that fine result as compared to iphone x. I believe that this is because of the telephoto lens of iphone x. But I am just hoping if theres a way so I wont opt to swap my iphone 12 to 12 pro 

Thank you very much in advance!

Just ordered the apple baltic blue 12 case. How is it after a while of using? Any pictures would be great. Also when the phone gets hot does the heat dissipate evenly over the phone or does it stay in the case?

I have been trying to find a case that fits over my dbrand skin (both sides and back) without too much trouble; why? I like to use my iPhone caseless at home (but preferably avoiding scratches hence the skin) but I prefer a case outdoors (to avoid drop damage) ..

I currently use a silicone apple case, although it fits over the skin the raised lips on the front are not raised anymore .. Im guessing its because of the skin underneath .. 
I was looking into spigen cases or mous cases, does anyone have some experience with them ?

On my iPhone 12 Pro Max, I recorded several video clips in 4K 60fps with HDR on. In the iPhone photo library, they look great. I merged them together using iMovie on the iPhone. It appears they remained HDR and I assume its still 60fps. When I upload to YouTube from iMovie app, while eventually a 4K version appeared, no 60fps version appeared and no HDR version.

Is it possible to upload 4K 60fps HDR from the iPhone? Or even 4K 60fps?

I have got my iPhone 12 PM a month ago, in the beginning I haven't used it that much as I was busy with work. Anyways long story short, in the first couple of weeks the phone was very good with the standby drain and it probably drained a percent every 90 minutes or a couple of hours which was fine by me (only on wifi and no sim yet as I had another phone and was too lazy to do the switch). 
I decided to rest the idle drain for a week and see how it performs (i usually do this my all my new phones just to get a gist of how it performs when left off the charger and with no activity)
Fast forward to today 6 am, I charged the phone to 100 after depleting it to zero in an attempt to recalibrate the battery indicator. I took it off the charger dropped from 100 to 99 in a very long time on idle and then to 98 97 so on until 94 percent in a decent expected trend. Then it started acting up losing the same one percent but in less than an hour sometimes even less than half an hour and still is doing this and the phone is now at 72 percent where is dashed through those 20 percent (from the 92 where it started acting up) in less than 6 hrs. 
What's happening I really don't understand. I have posted here before asking to share drain patterns but now I need help explaining mine. Is it a fault or a calibration issue or anything else?

I just got an iPhone 12 Pro and am looking to buy a leather case. My main concern is protection and design. I have Mous limitless on my old (iPhone 8) and I'm satisfied with the overall case quality.

Still, I kinda don't like the design of Mous for iPhone 12 pro so I've found Nomad rugged leather cases but except of slightly better appearance I couldn't find relevant reviews regarding protection of their cases.

Don't know whether to trust nomad or stick with mous?

Anyone with first sight info?

Hey everybody! My phone survived the great SMS text thread glitch of 2020 just to now seem to run into another very annoying problemwanting to see if anyone has experienced it. 

Specs: iPhone 12 Pro, iOS 14.4.

The short and easy explanation is that my volume buttons are intermittent (at best) with controlling my volume. When on my locker screen itll usually work, when on my Home Screen itll never work (so I cant adjust ringer or volume of anything playing when on my Home Screen), and when on the app (podcast, Apple Music) screen itll only work sometimes. My sure fire workaround right now has been to go to the control other devices screen and adjust the volume from there. 

So what makes this issue so frustrating is that it cant be a hardware issue because the volume button IS working in certain situations and still works for screenshots and turning off my phone. I have noticed that it DOESNT work anymore for taking photos. 

When I restart my phone, all functionality returns for a few minutes, but I cant tell what triggers it to stop. 

Any similar situations and what sort of fixes have you seen? I called Apple and they said to set my phone up as a new phone and dont download my data from backup, but Im really hoping yall have had something else that works besides having to manually redownload all my apps and change all my settings...again.

Hello! I like to hold on to my phones as long as I can but am finally upgrading from a 6S to a 12 mini. Im also a bit of a butterfingers so Im looking for a protective case that is MagSafe compatible because I want to get something like a Moft or MagSafe PopSocket to help offset my clumsiness. 

How well do the Apple Silicone or Leather cases protect from drops? 

I like the Mous Limitless and Rhinoshield SolidSuit (claims protection up to 11 drop I think) but dont do well with MagSafe. 

I considered Rhinoshield Mod NX but would like protection on the back, even though I plan to cover it with a Moft or PopSocket. 

I prefer slim simple cases with minimal branding so Casetify doesnt work for me. 

Any suggestions?

TL;DR

Looking for slim simple protective and MagSafe compatible 12 mini case

Edit: will also post in r/iPhone12mini

Does anyone have other concerns about the leather case too? Would love to know.

its gotta be possible for more accessories to exist than just cases, wallets, and chargers. i know popsocket has some stuff coming but come on is this all there is? how about something a la moto mods? i know it hints at apple moving to a portless device but is a wallet that holds barely 3 cards really all apple could come up with? come on apple!

I know the hold down volume down and side button trick. And the press volume up press volume down press amd hold side, wait for black screen then hold side and volume down until Apple logo then release side button only.  What is everything else possible that can be done using these buttons. What combinations or anything like the 2 processes i know can be done.  My iPhone 12 has been cloned.  Accounts stolen. Dont need advice like call apple. I do need what im asking if there even is other functions you can access with only buttons. Or a real way to reset or restore to factory that doesnt need drfone or itunes.  Cant do anything on cloned phone because they locked almost all menus and can close anything they want while on my phone. Talked to every "expert" and most common answer is thats not possible for someone to do that, fuck those answers cause its happening. I just want to clear this phone so its like new and go from there.

I know many have been concerned about this years leather cases and how much longer theyre taking to break in.

Im at exactly one month with my black leather case, and this week I finally noticed the leather softening. Its so gradual, of course, that I didnt notice it right away, but it feels much less like plastic and much more like the case on my X (mostly at the common touch points).

As far as appearance, its harder to tell on the black case than the saddle brown, but its definitely less shiny than it was new. Looks a little more matte, which is what I was hoping for.

Hopefully this helps anyone on the fence. Itll get there, but itll just take some more time.

Hey guys,

Im experiencing diziness and migraines with the new phone. My last phone was the Iphone 8 and I never had these problems. Since a month ago when I got this phone I thought I was having some health issues, but I realized its the phone thats actually causing them. Yesterday I decided to almost not use my phone at all and I felt great with no migraines whatsoever. Does anyone have some tips for this kind of issue? What can I do to minimize these problems that Im having? Its slowly becoming unbearable and I wanted to check if there are some options before I decide to give this phone to a family member and change to something more healthy for me. Thank you in advance!!

As the title says, my launch 12 Pro Max was working flawlessly with CarPlay for a while but now seemingly has the hardest time holding a connection to the car. (Just keeps disconnecting and reconnecting every few minutes)

Cable hasnt changed, although I can reproduce the issue on another Apple usb cable we have - so the only thing I can think that has changed is phone updates.

Has anyone else been experiencing issues with CarPlay and their phones?

First of all I want to say: Im not shitting on anyones happiness here. If you have your phone and your happy - amazing. Im happy for you. Genuinely.

But I cant seem to shake the display issues on the iPhone 12 and its driving insane. Literally from the minute I turned on the phone and started the initial setup I knew the screen looked massively different. The warm look and dull colours being the main issue. Ive had most of the new iPhones for the past few years so Im aware of what Apple is capable of and the high standards they have but this aint it. The phone feels cheap and the display just doesnt feel right. I was so excited for the iPhone 12 but Ive actually switched back to my older phone (XS) because of the issues Ive faced.

I dont know if its software or hardware. I really dont. But the screen just feels weird. The colours, the tint, viewing angles, just the pop isnt there. Its a real shame. Im disappointed to be honest and I think Ill be returning the phone. Its just sat in my draw collecting dust. Every day or two I think stop Im just making it up and bring a bit anal so I turn on the phone, put SIM card in, get setup and yeah. I switch back once again and get frustrated.

Maybe this is how Apple intentionally calibrate their displays now. Maybe their supply chain has cheapened out. Maybe its a hardware defect theyre hoping will stop being discussed so they dont have to recall devices. Maybe its a software fixable issue. I just need answers. Everything else is great btw. Apart from this one issue the phone is dope. But I stare at the screen all day. Its gotta be satisfying me.

Not ranting or hating. Just discussing, thoughts?

So I bought my iPhone 12 a couple of days ago and then I proceeded to buy a case protector for it, I didnt notice at the beginning but when I got home I realized that the side button wasnt working with the case on just when I took it off, I thought it was just the case so I returned and then bought another one same material but another brand more expensive cause I thought it could have been just the fact that the first one was cheap, but same story, the new case wasnt working either, at this point I was kind of stressed cause I had put time into it, I knew iPhone 12 is 6.1 inches so the size wasnt the problem, so I thought maybe its a weird coincidence, bought a third case, same material (silicone) but another style and made sure that the buttons were marked in the inside, but no, same thing, side button (the one to turn in on and off) wasnt working again, I was so frustrated I thought it was the phone, returned it and got a new one, no luck, none of the cases worked either, so the phone wasnt the problem, at end I bought a case that I dont like but its working and it somewhat loose on the sides and I can see that the side button its kind of making it pop out, I dont know what to do at this point, I like the phone, I ordered another type of case through Amazon hoping it will work, does this happened to any of you guys, do you know if there is something going with iPhone 12 and silicone cases? Or what do you guys think its the reason behind it?

Hi Everyone, 

I just got my new Iphone 12 yesterday, I had a hard time to transfer my data from my old Iphone 8+, I had to restart my Iphone 12 couple of times as it is stuck on the picture ( maybe because my Iphone 8+ is pretty slow). Then I managed to transfer data only, without apps and photo etc. This morning I tried to charge my phone with Apple usb c brick that I got from my Ipad 8, it suddenly get so warm, and I tried to listen to the back of the Iphone, it had some static noise. I left them charging for another extra hour, It wasn't hot anymore but the static sound is still there ( where the apple logo is ). Just wondering whether this is an issue on all Iphone 12 or just my phone is faulty?

It's 4 a.m. here, nearly 5. I'm going to pick an iPhone tomorrow around lunchtime, so between then and now, I just need a little bit of input. I've already watched sooo many videos and looked at so many reviews on the 12 and 12 pro, and yet I'm still stumped. So, I should mention this is going to be my first iPhone: I'm switching over from the first LG Harmony and I am very excited!

I want to know if the bit of extra RAM in the 12 pro really makes a difference when it comes to the future of the phone (future proof?) I really, really want to have this phone for at least 4 years, longer if it's possible. I do plan to take very good care of it. If I drop an extra $120 for the pro, besides paying for the extra camera specs, is it like paying for longevity? Is 64 GB a lot of storage, or would 128 be better? (I really would not know, my LG came with 2 GB of RAM so I cannot even begin to imagine 64 GB.) And for those that have seen or sort of handled both the 12 and 12 pro, which do you prefer?

Hey all 
I was charging my iPhone 12 PM wireless-ly today using my Samsung wireless charger, it was charging just fine and took a dreadful 3 and a half hours to go from zero to 96 percent.

 At 96 percent I decided to install the most recent ios update while it was still charging and given how slow the charge was past the 80 percent mark (one percent every 7 min).

 I was surprised to find my phone at 100% when the update was concluded (given the update lasted for about 8 min or so) so is there something wrong or is jumping 4 percent all of a sudden after the phone restarted normal?

Apple trade-in

Hi everyone.
I own an iPhone XS 64GB. It works perfectly but on the Apple website there the trade in option that values mine around 290 (that Ill use eventually for an iPhone 12). I saw also that the estimate between an iPhone XS 64gb and a 128gb (but its the same with all models) its only 20.
My question is: how often does Apple changes the values of the old phones? Its the right time to change it or should I wait for the new model at the end of year?
Thanks

Photo looks awesome when in edit mode.. Clouds and the sun is visible all popped up and vibrant. But once out of edit mode the Sun is not even visible it is all blown out completely. 
Turning off view full HDR for photos solves the issue by losing HDR photos. I need photos captured in HDR to be set as wallpaper as it is.

I got an iPhone 12 pro for my birthday in December. But ever since then it will randomly lose service. It doesnt matter where I am it just happens, but it does not happen in a pattern. So I did a network reset, I tried a factory reset, I got a new Sim card, and all of that still did not work. So Verizon is shipping me a new/free replacement phone. So I really hope to heaven that the new phone wont have any problems. Because if it does not work I have no clue what to do after that.

I have a question. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the original magsafe cases from Apple use NFC to convey the correct colour in the animation which shows up when you put the case on, right? I was wondering if there's any way to hijack this particular NFC and use it as a trigger for a shortcut?

As per title, does installing / having plenty of apps on the iPhone slows down the phone's performance overall ? What's the general concept like ? Or the amount of apps does not affects the phone's performance and/or battery at all ?

Hello everyone

Just sharing my point of view in case some people are torn between Iphones and Google Pixels.

I love phones, and am quite a Pixel fanboy (had all of them, also the 5).

But this year they failed to give it a flagship chipset and even if the S765g is decent, I feel it's quite slow sometimes and wanted to try something new.

  
After all the reviews bragging about the Iphone 12 camera now up-to-par with Pixels, I decided to give it a go. I also went over all the pics posted here in this subreddit about "wow, Iphone 12 have a fantastic camera" ; honestly, and not to offend anyone, but I am rarely blown away by the photos. But I said myself that maybe they are compressed, maybe they don't know how to take good photos ?

Well, now I know it wasn't just me. Videos are still stellar it's true, the best of any smartphones, but camera is "good" at best. Pixel is still way more reliable, more contrasty, more true to life, well just better in almost any scenario. And the portrait &amp; Night modes are far superior.

Anyway, the Iphone 12 is a fantastic smartphone, of course it's better than a Pixel 5, the hardware is superior in almost every way, and I love it, really.

I'm just disappointed by the camera, and the reviews and all the people praising its stills shots. Comparing hand in hand with my gf' Pixel 3AXL, the Pixel is still the best shooter and it's sad that last year 300 phone is still better than my 900 flagship.

Now I hope some people will read this before buying if camera is their top priority.

Hello guys!

I recently got an iPhone 12 and everything it's great except for some randoms wifi disconnections (0 data transfer, but still conected to the network). I have tried everything, even factory reset, including a couple of solutions in this same reddit but no luck for me. Could this be just a software issue and I have to wait for an update or this is definitely a hardware problem and I need to ask for a replacement?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!

Because I keep reading conflicting reviews, some people are very happy some say they are of poor quality. 

To be honest I had a magnetic folio for my iPad Air 3 and it was in pretty bad condition after half a year and now Im hesitant with apple accessories.

First of all, I love my iPhone 12, and I'm going to use it for many years to come, at least 5-6 years, just like my previous iPhone 6. I love my iPhone 12 so much because I upgraded from the 6, and it's such a huge huge difference that words can't even begin to describe.

But, just want to put this out here and see what everyone opinion is, for one, I'm definitely not upgrading my 12 to 13, even with all the features like 120Hz etc, I think it's really not important, and doesn't make much of a difference overall, my take is it's definitely NOT worth it, not even a bit. But to the many of you here, are you going to upgrade from 12 to 13 ?

I talked with Apple Support through Twitter and then on the phone. They suggested I reset the phone using this process. And they said it will more than likely fix the issues.

I just upgraded to iphone 12 min and noticed that there is no indicator when something is connected via bluetooth. Is there a customization option to have this show up on the lock screen or somewhere else? I use hearing aids and connect my phone to them with Bluetooth. It has been extremely useful being able to glance at the screen to verify my Bt connection and not have to go into settings and check bluetooth to see if Im connected.

I am upgrading from an iPhone XR to an iPhone 12 and I used to have Case Mate case that attached to magnets on top and bottom of the case, but now that I'm upgrading I'm looking for something similar. I think with Magsafe things are a little different considering the size of that ring on the back. Does anyone have a similar setup in their car and found a decent case for protection with the metal backing that will connect to the vent magnets?

I like the Otterbox Figura case on the Apple website but I dont want to pay $60 Canadian for a case.

Has anybody come across any similar cases (in pastel or bright colours :P) with a bit more coverage in the front? I got a silicone case on Amazon, but theres too obvious of a black outline between the case and my screen protector. I find it distracting. 

Thank you so much for your time!!

Does anyone else notice how ass the front camera is? I switched from the 8 plus to the iPhone 12 pro max and my 8 took better selfies. When I try to take pictures like low light lighting it just is like smoothing and blurry. Even when I go on Snapchat to take pictures they come out looking like trash. My 8 took better pictures in this lighting. 

Is their away to fix this? Has anyone else noticed this?

- background app refresh off 

As soon as I free more space everything works as normal, but like now where I have about 9GB left of storage switching between apps is very hard as there are lags and the device is struggling to keep many apps open. This is all solved when I free up more storage. I know this is due to the fact that when you open apps in background they need to store temporary cache files hence why free storage is needed (correct me if Im wrong)  ..but Im just wondering, isnt 9 GB still a lot of storage? Isnt requiring more of 9GB of free space a bit too much to keep the device working normally?

I've been using my new iPhone for over a month now and I have the screen time feature turned on since the first day. I find it quite useful because I noticed that I am spending way too much time on the phone and wanted to lower the screen time a little. This feature was a great way to track my progress and to see what I am actually spending my time on. However today my screen time stopped working. My widget showed nothing and when I looked into the settings and found the screen time section nothing appeared on the top where usually all the data and graphs were showing. I decided to turn the screen time off and on again to fix it. It started working but I lost all my screen time history. Is there any way to get it back now or is it completely lost? Also did this happen to anyone else before? What should I do if my screen time stops working again in the future? Thanks!

I had an iPhone se2 before this and currently have an iPad Air 4 and none of those devices are so yellow with True Tone. When I activated the feature on my 12 I thought I had night mode on, its so ridiculously yellow I cant enjoy the display and just turned it off. I actually use it instead of night shift now so I dont tire my eyes before bed, its that yellow. 

Do you guys have the same issue? I really love True Tone and I never turn it off on my iPad, the blue light hurts my eyes and I really wish to use it on my new phone but like I said its way too strong. Curious about your opinions.

Hello.

I'm thinking about buying an iPhone. I'm currently an Android user, but I got bored switching the OS everytime there's a bug on the system.

So, to all you iPhone users, should I pick iPhone 11 or 12? My major concern regarding 12 is battery life. I've seen a few posts around telling that iPhone 12 has a worst battery than 11's (tecnically, it's true, since 11 has a litte bit more battery).

Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

I want to be able to track my sleep but I wear it all day to track my steps, heart rate, activity etc and my battery is at around 40 percent by the end of the day so not enough to sleep and be able to charge and track my next days activities. Even if I could track a nights sleep once every couple days would be nice. I dont need it every night I know eventually I have to charge it. Oh I also put it in battery conserve mode but it wasnt tracking anything I noticed. Any tips tricks would be greatly appreciated TIA!

I came from a X so I never complained, but having tried an iPhone 11 lately I immediately noticed how much more smooth the iPhone 11 is.. the animations, changing apps and everything basically , whereas my 12 pro max stutters quite a lot and nothing seems too stable, from multitasking animations to simple games, it is just funny lol 

I learned to deal with the blacks not being blacks, the green tint and the yellow tone but now it's getting hilarious

So with apple, they release new versions every year no matter what. Its obvious it will be the iPhone 12s this year

After joining the iPhone side after 12 years of Android last year with the iPhone 11 its soon time to upgrade and pass my iPhone 11 to my Mum. Im really enjoying the change so have decided on a Pro model this time.
Now I also have a iPad Pro  which takes care of most of my media duties and photo editing etc, so will I really benefit from the Pro Max?

My main concerns are battery life, is the 12 pro as good or better than my current 11? 6-8 hours Screen on time and 32 hours total time on from 100 to 20% battery.

Is the Camera worth the extra for the Pro Max? I find the camera on my 11 excellent, much better than my wifes S20 and her daughters Note 20 ultra. 

Ive never owned a phone larger than a S9 plus which was 6.2 inch.

Hey all,

So as a longtime Android user I'm considering switching over to the 12 Mini. Size is the main issue: I've gone from the Droid Eris to the Rezound to the One M8 to the Pixel XL and now on a Pixel 3a; the 3a is the first non-HTC device I've ever used and the first step down in quite a while. And it's still too big for my tastes.

**So I would like a 12 Mini, but I would like to take FULL advantage of the MagSafe charger AND put at least edge protection on this. So I'm hoping that the RhinoShield CrashGuard NX will be the answer. But will the charger fit inside the bumper when attached to the back?**

If all goes well, I hope to decorate it with the yellow trim, and add a custom vinyl "JUST READ THE INSTRUCTIONS" landing pad target centered around the MagSafe attachment points. It should look somewhat like SpaceX's autonomous drone ship JRTI when finished.

**Also, does anyone with the CrashGuard NX feel that there is not enough clearance between the camera lenses and a table top when it sits on its back with said bumper case?**

Thanks for any first-hand feedback anyone could give. If you've got photos of your phone with both the bumper and the charger in place, that would be extremely helpful.

I havent had an iPhone since the 6S so this is the first time Ive had portrait mode on an iPhone. Just noticed my 12 Pro seems slow switching over to portrait mode. 

Family member has a 7 Plus and Ive tried portrait mode on that, and its faster switching across. The other modes are fine, just portrait takes a few seconds to switch. Not a big issue, just annoying when I go to take a pic and the subject moves.

Is this a iOS 14 bug?

If you see any black image at low background in a completely dark room closely or by keeping another iPhone side by side (other than 12) you will notice that the blacks are not pure black and looks greyish.

after seeing a post, I put a plain black background (https://imgur.com/t/wallpaper/NakfHv4)on my home and lock screens , made my room dark (important) and then on bringing down the control centre slightly so that the background gets blurred -BAMMM- green tint! Please try On your supposedly normal devices and check.  Its showing only on the control centre and Face ID scan screen. I took a screenshot and it doesnt show the tint in the SS.  I havent noticed it anywhere else. My blacks are completely black and no green tint on any of the settings menus nor on any other screen. Is this a software issue? If not , why is it so specific and occurs only on some screens? Please try it on your iPhone 12s and let me know if you see it.

I recently returned my iPhone 12 mini that I exchanged once because I thought it was a defect. If you try to shoot photos in low light or direct light source, you'll see a super obivous lens flare that is too glaring to not even notice. I gave up on the phone and asked for refund which they thankfully did. Then it got me thinking, could it be just the mini model? So I went into an electronic store that has all 4 12 models on display to test and my God.... All of them exhibited the same green dot or lens flare or mirroring on their camera and video. A friend of my who accompanied me was using an 11 pro max so I told him to whip out the camera and test it out and sure enough it was apparent once again. Now he hates for me it cause he couldn't unsee it anymore and it pissed that almost all the photos of his night shots has the green dots in them. To the untrained eye, you can't really tell but for most of us who knows a thing or two, it's really annoying once you see it cause you've basically paid $1000+ for something that shouldn't be appearing since it is after all an expensive phone. 

Try it out and see if its happening to you. Point your cameras at a direct light source or near a slight source and see if the dots or flare are apparent. Some are subtle for morning shots but for night shots, they're super apparent. 

Thing it's more so on the hardware than a software issue. Lens probably is a cheap glass or non coated (cutting costs but charging more).

Picked up a 12 pro max a couple weeks ago and am unfortunately getting ready to return it. The screen compared to the XS Max I upgraded from is awful. Colors are dull and theres a consistent yellow hue most noticeable on white screens. Looked at mine next to a display model at the store (confirmed all settings including auto brightness were set the same) and the display model looked noticeably better. 

Is it worth picking up a new one right away, or should I switch back to my XS Max for a bit while Apple works this out? From what I read online this seems like a pretty common issue, but havent seen many threads on it newer than November.

Good morning all together, 

Im currently deciding if Ill go for 64 or 128 GB for the iPhone 12. 
An important factor is thereby, how big fotos with the camera are (how many MB). I know iCloud backup exists and I could just upload them, but I just prefer to have it all ready on my phone. Which is also convenient in places with little to no mobile data available. 

So does any of you have any size number for me here? Would really appreciate it. 

Also im interested in what storage size you have on your own decide? 

Thanks!

Ive noticed that on my 12 Pro the video quality appears to be way better than my photo quality. For example, this morning I took a photo of the sunrise. I also took a short 10 second video. The quality, lighting, etc in the video was way better than the photo. I ended up taking a screenshot of the video to use as a photo.

And its not just in low light settings like with a sunrise. I also noticed this when taking photos/ videos in normal light settings (e.g., photos of people, objects, etc)

Has anyone else noticed this? Is this due to the hardware, or some setting I dont know about?

Anyone experiencing some huge amount of battery drain on iPhone 12 ? Huge for me at least. I do noticed that whenever I charge my phone up to 85%, and I wake up the next day, with DND on, it either drain only 0 - 1%.

When my phone is anywhere below 80%, the battery used to drain 3-5%, yet for the past few days, it's been draining more than 8-10% overnight. I checked battery usage, nothing seems suspicious, and my battery level is during the night is dropping from high to low on a constant level, not a steep drop. On good days I drain 3-5% overnight idle, and that's normal rate. But 8-10% doesn't seem normal. 

For the record, my background app refresh if OFF, Mobile Data is OFF, Location services OFF, etc.

I'm wondering if anyone else is seeing this. It is visible when you watch a YouTube video that has a mostly black background, especially old videos that don't fill the width of the screen. When you change the volume, causing the volume slider to appear, you see a white shadow alongside it that spreads across the entire width of the screen, more obvious in the side regions where there isn't any content.

Im a basic user, should I go for a regular 12 or pro? Would an iPhone 12 suffice?
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-01-21
I was going through the Apple communities which are flooded with this complaint and found someone mentioned that changing the mobile data to 3G stops the battery drain.

I tried and it worked! No more overnight battery drain since then.

It must be really embarrassing for Apple that people have to put their 5G phone on 3G to stop the crazy battery drain. So I hope they are listening and working on a fix.

Meanwhile, this is the workaround.

My original post here-

So I've seen numerous explanation about charge cycles and ehat constitutes a charge cycle. Based on Apple and also confirmed by numerous posters, it does not matter that it's a full charge and discharge. Therefore if it's from 50%-100% or 25%-75% its a half charge cycle. So it does not matter which level you are charging and discharging to. So my question is why does it matter that the recommended is to keep the charge between 30-80%? 

For example, I could do a 0-20% charge 5x for a full charge cycle and I could also do the recommended 30-55% 5x for a full charge cycle. Why is the later better for the battery when the number of charge cycle is the same for both? Similarly, 75%-100% 4x vs. 50%-75% 4x for e.g. Why is the later better?

As much as I've been loving my 12 Mini, there's been one strange issue  that has been irking me since the beginning. Sometimes when vibrating  (such as when the phone wakes up from a notification), the vibration would come with a very audible clicking sound as if something got stuck.  It sounds distinctly different and more 'harsh' than something like  haptic feedback and did not occur on my previous iPhone 7.

Below is my original post pasted from the Apple Support Forums with further details:

&gt;Under very specific conditions, I have found that my iPhone 12 Mini would include a short abnormal 'clicking' noise when vibrating (due to a push notification or any other reason that the phone may vibrate).  
&gt;  
&gt;Essentially, as long as the phone has been in a low-power state for long enough, for any vibration that wakes up the phone (or occurs at the same time as the phone waking up), the vibration would include a short clicking noise much sharper sounding than what haptic feedback could provide. For example, after about 30+ seconds with its screen off, if my phone were to get a notification from Instagram, the vibration from it would come with the strange click sound.  
&gt;  
&gt;I've noticed this issue occurs consistently with notifications that use the default flat vibration pattern (not accented) that comes with non-stock apps. However, I have also observed the clicking sound occurring from the charging indication vibration if the phone were to wake up just after a restart. As said before, the issue specifically arises from vibrations that occur when the phone is waking from some sort of low-power state.  
&gt;  
&gt;This issue is especially strange considering it doesn't seem to be independent to any particular iOS version or hardware. I've had my previous iPhone 12 Mini replaced with an entirely new device for this exact issue, yet the issue persists. Even on a clean install of iOS following a DFU restore, I find that the clicking issue persists under the exact same conditions. This issue has also persisted on every iOS version that my phone as been updated to (up to 14.3).  
&gt;  
&gt;I have reasonable suspicion to believe this is not an intended feature considering I've never experienced such a thing happen on my previous iPhone 7 running iOS 14. Perhaps the issue is ultimately inconsequential, but I worry it may damage the vibration motor/haptic engine the more it occurs. If anyone has information on a possible fix, please tell me!  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks!

Is it safe to buy these phones? I don't want to waste that much money if the majority of these phones have this issues. I read so many complaints, but I don't know if this is a vocal majority. Please help.

Hi there! I dont know whether it is a real issue with camera or just a way that phone procceses the images, but each time i compose and set the exposure i need and then take the photo, i click on it to view it and for a second it shows exactly what I saw when composing but then it immediately shifts and makes the photo a little bit brighter or with more clarity and sharpness and even colour temperature. The result tend to be a little artificial. I have tried everything form turning on/off Smart HDR, Scene Detection etc, but nothing changes even with thosr turned on/off. 

Is it an software issue?
Is that a certain way of processing the image?
Why does it doesnt show different results with HDR turned on/off? Thanks.

Hi guys. Just got my phone a few weeks ago. I bought a 20W fast charger to go with it, but dont have the extra wall plug to put it into. I have to unplug other things to charge my phone.

I then realized that I have an unused USB C port on my ASUS ROG Strix RTX 2070, and it works as an i/O throughput. Its convenient and charges fast too. 

Im just worried if the wattage on the port can mess with the phones battery. Can someone tell me if this is the case?

I currently own the iPhone 8 plus, which still has the home button and does not have the notch at the top. 
Which is exactly my concern, since I use my phone a lot to watch youtube and netflix.
Can someone maybe tell me if watching movies on the iPhone 12 is annoying with the notch. Does it cut of part of the content, and are there ways around it?

First of all, please don't judge me but I would admit I might be over reacting and over paranoid. As I "dropped" my iPhone 12 that I got it yesterday. I was driving earlier, and I happen to put my iPhone 12 in the middle of where I sit, so it's basically right in the middle of my genital area.

I was making quite a harsh turn and the phone actually fell to the side of the door and drop to the carpet, to me it wasn't really a drop at all, but it did knock the side and then fell. I took it up immediately and well the phone and the case looks exactly the same as before the drop, that made me felt good. But I'm worried that with this slight drop it might hurt the inside of the hardware, would it ?
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-01-20
I have experienced all of these issues, as have many of you, and I'm tired of it. The Apple stores are closed locally, and I don't really want to send my phone in and be without one only to get a phone with even more problems. Why haven't they addressed these issues? The Apple support said it was software related then changed their mind and said it was hardware with no new informationbasically they had no idea what they were talking about. They even said they were new to the job. Seriously, fuck this. Let me talk someone that actuality knows something.

iPhone is the WORST smartphone I've ever experienced purchase for more than 10 years, in terms of keeping the camera room out of dust.

What the hell is happening in its assembly room.

The 12 'Pro Max' is at least a $ 1,100 product. And Apple is forcing its customers to go through several tiresome refund and repurchase process, because it doesn't give shit about quality control especially about dust inflow. Units are returned and returned every day. Great environment saving like it brags about.

Hello. Ive been debating for a few weeks whether to upgrade to an iPhone 12 or 12 pro, now that my XR is eligible for an early upgrade. Apparently I still have seven more payments until this phone is paid off, but I could upgrade early. AT&amp;T is making it kind of cost prohibitive with their requirements of upgrading to their unlimited data plan. As of now, I pay $132.17 per bill for 6 GB of data shared between myself and my husband. What the new plan would cost would be $155 for two unlimited data plans (which apparently does not include a hotspot!?) This does include $700 trade-in credits for my XR, and I believe this was the quote for the iPhone 12, and not the iPhone 12 Pro. 

tl;dr  is the iPhone 12 (not pro) worth paying an extra $23 a month on my wireless bill, or should I just stick with my boring but reliable XR? 

Also, If I wait until my other phone is paid off, can I upgrade to an iPhone 12 and not have to pay for unlimited data plan? I dont know if we have 5G around here, So I dont know if I want to be paying for something I dont even need.

Hello everyone,I got my iPhone 12 for Christmas (on 25th Dec) but didnt touch it until days later because of the lack of case.Anyways,I am coming from a Samsung S8+ and I dont know if its me that Im overthinking or not adapting myself to the phone or that iPhone 12 is trash.

Ive had different problems with the mobile:
1st. Exponential numbers? WHERE CAN I FIND THEM?
2nd. Facial ID. My mobile does not usually recognice my face with Facial ID. Ive tried different times,with every type of light and with the screen clean and I have to put the code :(
3rd. Screen brightness...sometimes when Im outside my phone just turn the brightness to the minimun possible and I cant put it at the intensity that I want because it stays the same brightness...
4th. The Battery overheats when Im talking to the phone,when the mobile is not in use and charging,when using it for no reason (I didnt have any data from apple before and I noticed the overheat since the day 1) 
The battery also lasts less than a day and it decays very quickly although I always try to charge it in a moment in which I know Im not goint to take it and Im not going to leave it charging overnight
5. Data/Wifi/Signal... Ive never had any problem with my others mobiles with the signal in the underground parkings that I usually go but with the iPhone I have...and I sometimes havent got even when Im in a car (because if I get out of the car it SOMETIMES get signal) and with the Data...its the same. I disable 5G because I have read that spends a lot of battery and it does not work as I wish (as the S8+ e.g) 
I dont know what to do and Im thinking about selling it...can anyone help me?

###[Imgur Album With My Photos of Streaks](https://imgur.com/a/9bIVBLS)


Has anyone encountered any issues with their iPhone 12 Pro camera when it comes to streaks appearing in daylight pictures? They seem to appear in high sunlight, medium sunlight, or low sunlight situations and it just sucks because they clearly ruin the picture. I also don't notice any visible scratches or cracks to the camera lenses and as far as I can recall I haven't dropped the phone since I've gotten it.

Everywhere and here the awesome features of the iPhone 12s is of an "unbelievable!" or "shockingly detailed!" photo or video taken with the phone. 

We know too well already the beauty of the camera and it's covered and raved about already in every forum and product reviews. Sometimes it feels like that's about the only major feature of the iphone because everyone's only ever talking and posting about those.

Are there other things to look forward to on the iPhone 12s for non photography enthusiasts and people who don't care about the camera quality?
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-01-18
I upgraded from an iPhone 7 Plus that I had for a few years. Never used a screen protector. On that phone and all of my previous phones, my finger glided nicely on the display without issue.

I've noticed with my new 12 Pro my finger often doesn't glide nicely--almost as if the moisture in the air/on my skin is causing a kind of "drag" when I try swiping on my screen. It doesn't prevent me from using the phone but sure has gotten annoying.

Has anyone else noticed something similar? Or I'm wondering if maybe the oleophobic coating wasn't properly applied to mine. I do have AppleCare+, so if this is an isolated issue I'd hope Apple would be able to just swap out my screen.

They seem to have many more options than anyone else and ones that interest me are like the bronze and rose gold, etc. Also ColorWare doesnt do skins for the frame, but ES does.

Yes, I know DBrand exists, but frankly, they have a very limited selection that doesnt really appeal to me.

iPhone 11 or iPhone 12?

Hi everyone! Im just stopping by to get an opinion - I apologize if too many people have asked this same exact question (they probably have). Im the type of person who needs external opinions to make a decision, especially for big purchases such as this one. 

I have an iPhone 8plus and Im coming to the end of my payment period. I want to upgrade to either the 11 or 12 but I really cant decide. Help!

Ive wanted the iPhone 11 for a long time (the purple is gorgeous), however Im also a sucker for the newest, shiniest stuff - hence my indecisiveness between the 11 &amp; 12. 

Factors important to me:
Cost
Battery Life
Camera

Things I am considering:
5g
Overall look
Performance in the future digital climate

I would be wonderfully appreciative of any feedback you might have. Thanks in advance!

TL;DR I am incredibly indecisive when it comes to big purchases, and need help choosing between the 11 and 12!

I am sure I have a lot of dust that could scratch the sides, how do I remove it first? My modes is the graphite model 
Would a vacuum work?

Not sure if I got a busted model or I should adjust my expectations coming from a Pixel 2 as my new iPhone 12 mostly works very well with the iPhone-specific basics (ie. phone calls, iMessage, AirDrop, sharing wifi with other iPhones, etc.) but any step beyond that seems to be a struggle. It seems in general, iOS is a lot less efficient than stock Android but could just be my inexperience. Hopefully I'm just missing some features and someone can provide some solutions?

Wifi keeps dropping when phone is locked even when I am right next to the router. It shows the phone is connected to the wifi in Settings but the top right still says 5G.

Shortcut bookmarks don't work on the home screen. I'll reset the phone and it'll work for a bit but it ends up failing after a while.

Scrolling is wonky on the google apps I think. It's very easy for the screen to keep scrolling after the initial finger scroll and not stop when I place my finger on the screen again, essentially not recognizing the second touch, hopefully that makes sense. Seems to happen very often with the Google search app, Chrome, although surprisingly not gmail.

Is there seriously no way to toggle between silent, vibrate only, and ring only without manually changing the settings? I don't want to be attacked by vibrations during a group text barrage but also want to keep vibration on for calls so would be great if there's an easy way to toggle.

Is there no way to turn off passcode/Face ID requirements when at home or connected to some wifi?

Is it also not possible to add a timer in between requiring a passcode/Face ID when locking the phone, as in only require passcode/Face ID if it's been [x] minutes since last lock?

How do you automatically trigger passcode unlock instead of Face ID in the instances where I know the phone is not able to scan my face, usually when it's flat on a table? Do you have to wait for it to figure out Face ID isn't working first?

Any good alarm apps? All i want is something more user friendly and more efficient to navigate than the stock. All the apps I've downloaded only let you set wakeup times in increments of 5 minutes?

Anyone know of a stock tracker app that shows % returns based on selected date range (1 month, 3 months, YTD, etc.)?

Have not seen any noticeable difference between LTE and 5G though that may just be a T-Mobile thing. Has anyone else?

All of these things worry and annoy me, and Im not sure what to do since it seems like its everyones phone. Will there be a recall of its the panel?

Just got the clear apple MagSafe case  and I like it  but it slips out of my pocket too easily (like when I cross my legs). What can I do to make it a little more sticky/grippy, without making it look like crap? I figure I can carefully scuff up the edges with sandpaper, or...? 
To be clear, I want to 1) keep this case,  and 2) still have it look good and (mostly) clear. Is there some type of clear spray paint that is a bit tacky when dry?

Hi guys, i got my first iphone.. i've always been againts iphones but i never tried to buy one, so now i'm here :D

I can say that iphone 12 is a really good phone but there's one thing that not convinces me: the touchscreen. I don't know if it is 100% precise (vs android phones) but i found myself to tap more than once in small spots because i wasn't able to, for example, go back to the previous page on facebook or telegram. I dont' have big fingertips.

Also when i browse the gallery and i have to make a multiple selection i need to tap on photos more than once in most cases...or i'm too fast or, idk, there's something wrong.

What's your experience?

Is it possible to remove apps label on iphone 12 running on 14.3. It should not be by shortcut icons, that works without label, but the notification banner never goes away. So if anyone knows how to remove label from apps without creating shortcut, that will be great.
This is such a simple, I dont understand why apple can not give us freedom in customisation.

I have the saddle brown leather MagSafe case and when I put it on the phone, theres supposed to be an animation that verifies which case it is. Mine doesnt do that. It worked before and has recently stopped. My other MagSafe cases work fine so its not my phone.

Hey all
With what's going in the world right now, we find ourselves mandated to put on face masks almost all the time or at least most of the time.
Many have suggested that Apple has to put in a fingerprint reader along the faceID to be able to unlock the phone in situations like this and I totally agree with this. 
However, there is a feature that you guys could use IF you are affected by having alternative appearances (masks, glasses, etc)
Go to Settings, under faceID and recognition, go to setup alternative appearances and go ahead and setup as many appearances as you want. I have done it and it has come in handy when I have my glasses and my mask on.

Received my 12 Pro about a month or so ago (upgraded my 11 Pro). From day 1 I have been getting headaches and vertigo. I never had any issues with PWM flicker on any of my old iPhones. For the past 5 days I've been using an Android phone and have had zero issues, when I had an issue every single day with the 12 Pro.

Has anyone had issues specifically with the 12 series but not on older OLED iPhones? I love the phone but I may have to go back to an 11 Pro.

iPhone 12 camera quality

I guess let me explain my phone history. I came from an iPhone 7, and then a Pixel 2 XL. Now I just got an iPhone 12 pro max. I must say most of the photos I take are amazing. I am just glad I dont have the graininess of the Android anymore. 

But... taking some pictures in the gym today, I cant help but notice how smooth it makes my skin look. Its horrible. One thing I loved about my pixel camera was how well it contrasted the shadows. Made muscles pop... typical gym rat stuff. 

I literally replicated the same pictures on my pro Max that I took 2 days ago on my pixel and the difference is night and day. Just cant believe Im this dissatisfied with a top of the line camera. 

Is there anything that I can do to change this? Is it a digital processing effect with apples software? Would removing HDR change this?

What is the actual definition of the iPhone 12 Pro Maxs screen? Is it 4K? How does screaming apps quality work?

I ask this because for example on Disney+ app for 4K UHD HDR titles it says it is HD. So iPhones screen better than Full HD but will reduce steaming to 1080p Full HD on streaming apps like Disney+, Netflix, etc?

btw I apologize if this question has already been asked. 

I received the iPhone 12 for Christmas and my mom told me that I have to use the Apple MagSafe wallet because other phone wallets will demagnetize my credit card strips. However, I cant find anything online saying that the MagSafe wallet is the only wallet that you can use with the 12. 

Is it safe to use like any phone wallet on the back of the 12? Will it demagnetize my card strips if I dont use the MagSafe one?

I got my iPhone 12 yesterday. Been enjoying it so far. 

Today I noticed that while it is plugged in it is making some weird noises. From the back of the phone you can hear a high pitched whine, as well as some cracking/static noises that almost sound like a wire short. 

I took it in to bestbuy (the nearest Apple store is over an hour away) after making the appointment on apples website. The service tech couldnt hear the noises, which wasnt surprising in a large store. 

Anyone else experience this? Any solutions? My next step is an appointment at Apple Monday morning. 

Thanks.

I have a pair of Bose II noise cancelling headphones and a pair of wireless JLab earbuds. Neither of which are showing up in my iPhones Bluetooth list, even though they connected to my old iPhone X no problem. Are these devices simply incompatible with the 12 or is their something wrong with my phone in particular?

Ive had the regular iPhone 12 for almost 2 months now. I never get more than 1 or 2 bars of cellular network in my workplace. My secondary phone ( a 5 year old inexpensive android) consistently has all 4 bars (same carrier, so thats even more frustrating) in the very same locations, as do most of my colleagues with far worse android phones. Ive tried everything- from toggling airplane mode to rebooting my iPhone. Hell, Ive even ejected and reinserted my SIM multiple times in the past couple of weeks to no avail. The poor network takes a toll on my battery life even when Ive barely used my phone at work all day. If youve faced the same issues, please do help me out with suggestions/ workarounds as this is my first ever iPhone and Im miffed that such an expensive phone (the regular 12 costs $1090 in my country) cant even do the bare minimum to an acceptable standard. 

P.S Theres no 5G in here, so the network is always in 4G LTE mode.

So here's my experience with installing an u/XtremeSkins product on my iPhone 12.

I got the matte back with the glossy camera cover, both clear, I wanted to emulate the iPhone 12 Pro look on my regular 12  a poor man's 12 Pro, if you will. Ordered in December, arrived 14 days later (in Canada).

Installation was not too difficult and didn't deviate much from their video instructions so I'll just mention the hiccups I encountered.

1. Installing the rear panel was a breeze. The bad news: I ran out of Xtreme Juice (the fluid they use in clear skin installs) RIGHT AWAY. Like, the instructions said "be generous" but I got overzealous and overestimated how much juice they actually pack in there. A heads up would have been nice lol. Better still, a larger juice bottle. (The very nice team did let me know they could hook me up with more, which I might in the future if I ever need it, but...14 days shipping...)

2. Because of (1), the side panels were a bit more finicky to install. I wasn't able to centre them as precisely as I would have liked, a bit stuck out here and there. Also at the top of the phone, two of the side panels ended up overlapping. Just by a smidgen, but it was still detectable by touch. I ended up having to remove the sides anyways because they caused my phone to not fit into its case. So, no harm, no foul.

3. The camera panel install went without a hitch, until I took a closer look and discovered that the punch-out for the microphone hole had somehow hitched along for the ride and was neatly covering the rear microphone hole. Delicate surgery with a pair of tweezers was called for, which ended with a slight dent to my microphone grille (not noticeable from a distance by any means, but Im anal about these things so )

Overall I'd give the entire experience about a 7/10. Actually an 8/10, because their people actually take the time to reply, not to mention actually SHIPPING the product (lookin at you, Slickwraps). The back and camera were what I ended up installing, and it's been really great being able to handle my phone naked without fearing for fingerprints and micro-scratches etc. However the now-dented microphone grille will glare into my soul forever.

Please note this is only a review of the install process, after a few weeks I might post another review about the product itself.

Hey all
I have an issue with my iPhone 12 PM when I charged the phone the other night to 60 percent, I switched off my phone and when I turned it back on the percentage increased to 64 percent. Is that normal? 
I know it might be a calibration issue,but I didnt expect this to happen with the new software.
Please let me know if this is normal or not and has anyone experienced this before

I have had a Galaxy S8 for about 2.5 years when I got a new iPhone 12 Pro last month. 

The regular Galaxy S21 and S21+ don't seem like they are an upgrade from the Galaxy S20 and S20+. The camera system is literally the same, the design is worse in my opinion (flat screen, no curved display which was iconic for Samsung and still a big chin) and they removed expandable storage. The only big change is the new SoC, which is really a lot faster and more efficient (at least in the Exynos regions) but the price dropped. 

In contrast to that the Galaxy S21 Ultra is a big improvement. Altough the design didn't change much too, the camera and especially zoom got much better, it supports S-Pen (which isn't included when you buy the phone) and it offers generally better specs. 

Samsung doesn't include a power brick anymore. The funny thing is that the cable they give you is USB-C to USB-C so the argument with the environment is a lie since very few people have a compatible adapter for that. 

I have a 240hz monitor at home for my PC but I personally think high refresh rates on phones are useless. I didn't notice the difference between 120hz on an iPad Pro and my iPhone 12 Pro and I also couldn't tell if I was using the regular Galaxy Note 20 (60hz) or Note 20 Ultra (120hz) in a tech store so I honestly don't care about it.

Overall I am extremely satisfied with my iPhone 12 Pro and also glad that I switched from Android.

hey all, i am currently using the apple leather case with my 12 mini, and the quality just isnt doing it for me. ive seen some remarks that apple stepped down the leather quality for the 12 series. i want to use a better leather case that will develop a patina over time. i love the look of the bullstrap line, but theirs dont appear to cover the bottom edge, and i want full coverage. i also want magsafe compatibility. 

any recommendations or links would be much appreciated. thanks!

I just picked up an iPhone 12 Max Pro and I want to use it as a first step into the world of videography. I want to start casual, perhaps filming in local parks and even just around my house. 

One of my first ideas was to film my record collection with some cool shots of the vinyl spinning and what not.

Im assuming Ill need a tripod, preferably one with height that is able to bend for certain angles. Then I assume I need a solid mount to hold this phone, its pretty heavy. Would any of the users here be able to recommend me some solid products?

If I am in the wrong community to ask this question, please forgive me and would you mind to recommend where I should post this?

Probably just the app itself... but have you tried loading a black video screen on Youtube app (full screen, landscape), and when you try to press the volume on your iPhone (up or down), the bar shown above the screen emits a background that does not match well with the black color of the video.

Tried it with other streaming apps such as Netflix and Prime but it is not the case, so maybe it is just the app itself not being able to fully adapt yet?

Ive noticed just this now while in the dark. That when I performed a restart on my phone. That when I powered the device back on; that when the Apple logo appeared, the blacks were black. No flickering or glow what so ever. However it wasnt until a couple of seconds before the lock screen appears, that that glow/flicker appeared. Ive gotten the same results every time Ive tested the restart.

Im wondering what it is in the OS that is causing this glow/flicker on the 12s displays. 

Feel free to test this yourself, Im really hoping that this is just a matter of needing a software update and that there wont be a need to recall any devices.

Hey! 

After months of contemplation, Im considering an iPhone 12 over the 12 Pro Max (coming from 11 Pro Max). 

One of the things that reviews online have stressed about the 12 Pro Max is that its better for gaming because of the bigger screen.

 I dont play much games, but I do play COD or Clash on my current 11 Pro Max, I also read off of Books or Kindle. Screen size never really bothered me before, but Ive pretty much forgotten what using a phone smaller than 6.5 inches feels like. 

The two factors that I have boiled this down to over picking which phone to get (the 12 or the 12 Pro/Pro Max) is the Dolby HDR recording in 30 FPS versus Dolby HDR 60 FPS on the Pro models, and the screen size being used for gaming or leisurely reading. 

I forgot the specs but does the front camera support HDR recording? I have also read that most movies that are shot are done so in 30 FPS instead of 60. Not that I am going to be filming the next Oscar-winning film on my phone but Im using cinematic movies as a reference point to compare the frame-rate image quality.

I have big hands and can text okay with just my right hand with the 11 Pro Max. There have been times where I wish I had something smaller to hold though. 

I wouldnt read for a super long time off the 11 Pro Max, and believe that having even just a few grams less of weight would help with hand fatigue. Then this ties back to screen size 

Thank you for your answers and feedback(s)! I really appreciate it.

So I had this awful splotch on my stainless steel frame, it was scratched by my case and it could be seen on any angle and lighting.

I used Cape Cod to polish this out, but in direct lighting I can see specs of dots in the mirror finish that wont rub off and is caused by the polish.

Also the polish is leaving streaks of scratches on the metal frame. I understand that this process creates micro scratches, but this doesnt look right to me. These scratches are very visible.

Is this supposed to happen? I dont recall my Apple Watch having these problems when I polished it last year.

With a few days left to buy AppleCare, I decided to just get it since you can do monthly payments now so why not

But then Im also someone thats basically never dropped my phone outside of maybe one slip onto the carpet every 9 months or so.

I figured if I have AppleCare I could go caseless and enjoy the full thing, and another big factor is because of COVID Im very OCD about wiping down the phone after everytime Im out, taking it out of the case and everything. So I might aswell just leave it out all the time. Will probably get a pop socket or something to even out the camera bump if having no case. (Realise this is probably unnecessary but Ive noticed how many surfaces I place my phone on and rather be safe).

Or I could cancel the AppleCare and keep the case I have (Gear4 Battersea so quite protective) get a screen protector, and maybe even a Dbrand skin to go under the case to prevent scratches. The skin also would hopefully  keep some dust out as the case is perfect apart from the camera cutout being too big so theres a lot of space for dust to get trapped. OCD wiping would still happen with all this aswell.

Unusual question I know but any suggestions?

hi! so, i placed my iphone 12 on my macbook pro, like, on the keyboard pushed against the screen (idk if you understand what i mean) (2019 13 model), while facetiming because its useful and ive been doing that since like 2014... but.. the screen reacted to the magnet in the back of my phone, it started showing green and purple lines on my macbook screen and as soon as i noticed i grabbed my phone back. 
is it dangerous? did i just damage my screen? thanks ! and sorry if i made mistakes english is not my first language :)

The area around the cameras, not the lens or the ring just the glass that holds the 3 cameras.
The model I have is the graphite, Ive heard that glass scratches can be removed with micro fibre and toothpaste?
From my understanding nobody yet has any sort of micro scratches there yet , so it kinda bothers me especially after all the care I take. 
Does anyone have any suggestions? I wouldnt want to ruin anything doing it
Mine is only available under light at certain angles, but it aint even a month old and it already has a micro scratch

I have a really specific case comparison: the Apple leather case vs. the Spigen Liquid Air. Im hoping there are at least a few others like me who tend toward these two.

Im a little disappointed with my Apple leather case, which doesnt want to patina and feels like its adding more bulk in comparison to previous years. 

Has anyone tried both of these cases on the 12 and can offer me their thoughts? Which is less invasive, which is lighter, which feels better in the hand, etc.

I do have Applecare+ my wife doesnt use one on her iPhone X. I hate this anxiety (OCD)

Anybody have any tips and tricks for making the switch smoother? I have already figured out how to customize my icons! Long process for sure! Anybody know how to make ringtones or am I forced to buy them . Any and all advice greatly welcome! TIA!!!

Hey, I got my iphone 12 the other day and i am super satisfied. My only question is if the keyboard vibrates out of the box when you type or did i do something wrong? And the other thing. I found some wipes called iswipes from like 2013 and the iphone 4 days and used them to clean my screen.

They include alcohol and chlorhexidine. Could this in any way damage the coating of the sceen or something like that? I'm just really careful because i spent this much on a phone.

Is the official case made by Apple really worth the extra money? I've seen people say that they don't hold up very well, discolor and sometimes don't fit the phone properly. This makes me hesitant to spend $50 on one when I could get a similar 3rd party case for like $35 less. Also, having never used a phone with a case that covers the side buttons, how does this impact the feel and clickiness of the buttons?

I don't understand it. I turn my phone off everyday when I go to sleep and when I turn it on the next day, it will either be yellow throughout the entire day, or one day it will be natural white and looks perfect. Turning the phone on and off throughout the same day doesn't change anything. Only when you turn the phone on at the start of the next day.

This is probably gonna be a long post...

Off the bat, the experience of the MagSafe wallet will be different for everyone. EVERYONE! The reason I say this is because every review Ive read and seen has said bad and good things, mostly bad though. For me however, its good. And it also really depends on how you use your phone, what pants/shorts you wear, how you use a wallet etc.

I have the 12 Pro Max for reference and I am a guy.

I personally put my phone in my back pocket. I wear pants 99% of the time. I wear both somewhat tight jeans and not so tight jeans. I love minimalist wallets. I really only keep 3 cards on me. ID, 2 credit cards. I use 3 different cases. A clear case (not MagSafe), Apple Leather case (MagSafe), and a bumper case (a bumper case only covers the sides of the phone so it is automatically a MagSafe case).

The Price: $60 USD
First of all, its a wallet. It is advertised as a wallet, a minimalist wallet at that. Now I have spent more than $60 on wallets before. So for me, $60 on a wallet is reasonable. Obviously not everyone has $60 sitting around to spend, that being said, your first immediate thought should be Are you okay with spending $60 on a wallet? No? Then dont read any further and stop looking into the MagSafe wallet. Remember the only function of this is to be a wallet, a card holder. That is all, that is is the original purpose of a modern day wallet, to hold your cards.

The Design
Once you are pass the point of price, next up is the design. Again it is a wallet, a wallet that attaches to your phone (iPhone 12 and above) without a case or with a MagSafe case. If you dont have a MagSafe case or dont use one Ill touch on that later in a different section. This wallet holds 3 cards, DO NOT TRY TO FIT 4! Unless youre literally using paper cards (which is highly not recommended) 3 cards max. Also this is not a wallet meant for people who like to carry cash, if you want to carry cash or you must carry cash, then either do not buy this or buy a money clip (you can buy them for cheap for around $5 USD). Now your next question(s) should be Can I go through my daily life with only 3 cards? No? Then stop right here and do not buy this product And do I need to carry cash with me? Yes? Then do not buy this product or buy a money clip and proceed to the next section

The Feel
Its leather. Its premium. Are you against leather? #saveTheAnimals? Then dont buy this product.

The Usability
Cool, chances are all thats left is to purchase this wallet. So do it, as long as you keep your receipt and or are able to fully get a refund you have no reason to at least try it out during the return window. Furthermore, if you do not know the return window, ask! The general rule for return windows is I believe 14 or 7 days (here in the US). (Time skip some time) You open up your package, attach your wallet for the first time and it feels good. This whole section is honestly just purely opinion based. I have yet to have this wallet fall off for me. You can try it out yourself, try it without a case and with a MagSafe case (if you have one) you will feel the difference between the 2 choices. I personally like the bit of added weight I get when I have it on. Taking out the cards from the little hole on the back makes it easy to take out the cards, I would highly recommend to put the card you use the most in the back where the hole is, this way you can always guarantee that this will be the first card you take out. If you put your phone in your back pocket like I do, I highly doubt it will ever fall off. Your front pocket is a different story, this will be different because it depends on how you take out your phone from your pockets. If you grab the sides of your phone while taking it out of your pocket, chances are your MagSafe wallet will be in your pocket when you take out your phone. If you grab your phone with your whole hand then you have no worry about the wallet staying in your pocket. If you grab the top of your phone then depending on the phone you have it may or may not stay in your pocket (more on this later). I also personally love the fact that I have an empty pocket now or in some cases 2 empty front pockets (I sometimes, rarely use a money clip for when I know I go to places that require cash).

The iPhone 12 Mini
The wallet is an exact fit for the mini so chances are no matter where you put your phone with the wallet it wont fall off, why? The mini is exact making it so your gonna grab the wallet along with the phone almost at all times. The only caveat is using this with a bumper case on the mini, bumper cases have a slight lip on the back so that way the phone doesnt touch the surface you place your phone on, so if you use a bumper on your mini or plan to, you most likely wont be able to use the MagSafe Wallet

The iPhone 12 / iPhone 12 Pro
Theyre both the same size, so one section. This is where how you take out your phone and where you place it starts to matter more. Putting on the MagSafe wallet leaves this bezel on the bottom of the phone. If you grab your phone by the sides or the bottom/top of the phone when in your front pocket, decent chances it will stay in your pocket. Again it matters how much of your hand grabs your phone when in the pocket to take it out.

The iPhone 12 Pro Max
Pretty much the same as the 12 and 12 Pro, however you have more of a bezel on both top and bottom so the where you put your phone and how you take out your phone matters even more. Again if you put your phone in your back pocket, you should be perfectly fine.

No case
The wallet attaches fine, it is neither strong or weak. If bumped hard enough it will fall off. Using it without a wallet does make it easier to use as far as taking off the wallet to take out a card. So that would be the biggest pro to using no case.

Clear cases (not MagSafe)
Most generic clear cases and by that I mean unless you get a very slim clear case or a very bulky one. Theyre all the same thickness. It still attaches, however, it is not very strong. It will still stay there but if you bump your phone, very good chance it will fall off.

Apple Leather Case (MagSafe)
By far the best way to keep your wallet attached. Why? After your leather case absorbs the oils from your hands and develops the patina this starts to make the case sticky, not actually sticky but itll feel more grippy the leather. This makes the wallet attach better, so much so that after I think 15mins, unless you actively try to take it off, its not coming off. Downside, youll see a very faint and I mean very faint unfinished circle on your leather case.

Bumper Case
Same as using the phone naked, just with a bumper case. Very important though if you have a mini, it is recommended to not use both a bumper and a MagSafe wallet as most bumpers have a back lip to prevent the phone from touching the surface of where you place the phone. This lip will make your wallet fall off very easy.

TLDR: $60 too much? Dont buy
Need more than 3 cards or need to carry cash? Dont buy
Not a fan of leather and #saveTheAnimals? Dont buy

I wish so badly that Apple was producing a smart folio-like product for the iPhone 12 lineup. Not a case in its traditional sense, but a magnetic cover to keep it from scratching when thrown into a pocket or purse. 

With MagSafe this seems like a total missed opportunity. 

Then again I may be the only one. Am I?

I understood the reason and logic behind this, is to prolong the lifespan of iPhone's battery. But why 40-80% ? What if I charge my phone at 30% ? Would that make any difference when at 40% ? 

Should I stop charging at 80% ? Would it hurt the battery at all to go at least say, 85% ? I'm just plainly curious about this.

So I took the plunge and upgraded to an iPhone 12 mini from an iPhone 6. I also switched from GoogleFi to Xfinity. And now I cannot message any groups with a mixed group of phones. At all. I still receive the messages but my responses do not go through. Nor can I send photos to anyone on an Android. Yes, I have MMS and Group Messaging on. I have spoken with Xfinity, I have made sure everything is upgraded, I have reset my settings. What am I missing? So bizarre.

I recently got an iphone for the first time, and I've noticed that when I plug my charger in, there is a 2-3 second delay between when I plug in the cable and when the phone starts charging. It's not a big issue, but I was wondering if anyone else experiences the same thing. 

I'm using Apple's 20W charger and Apple's lightning cable. Battery-optimization doesn't affect it, and the charging port is clean with new cables.

When I watch youtube video's of people charging the iphone 12, it appears to be almost instant.

I say slightly let down but its literally a non-issue. I feel all cases with the squared edges are a bit more difficult to get on and off due to said edges vs. the older models rounded edge. However, in all the Apple iPhone 12 ads/trailers, it seemed there was heavy emphasis on how the MagSafe cases just simply clicked into place. Like there wasnt much support from the sides of the case to hold it on, but mostly held by the magnets. Apple even said that it would be the easiest iPhone yet to interchange cases and accessories because of MagSafe. 

This is, as said earlier, a non-factor for me. However, I thought the idea of it was really cool. Anyone think that was actually their intent but in reality it just didnt work? Maybe as MagSafe evolves this will become a reality? 

Just my Sunday afternoon sailing away on reddit with real thought provoking stuff...lol

Hello everybody!
Bought my 12Pro Gold on the Apple Store online and received it at the end of November. Aesthetically speaking, this one might be the most beautiful mobile phone ever, hands down. Really digging the gold finish and appears to be very resistant too! Been using it naked for the whole time and it still looks perfect,  o scratches at all! Ergonomically speaking tho, not so good (at least for me) due to the sharp edges. 
My happiness was sadly short lived tho, took me 48 hours to notice two big problems;

1) The screen is awful. I own an iPhone X and an iPhone 8 and both screens look way better. 
My 12 Pros screen appears to be yellowish and dim. It kind of lacks contrast, and at the same time the screen is not bright at all (constantly using it at 90% brightness level all the time, except nighttime). Turning off AB improves things a little bit but one should not be forced to do so in order to enjoy it. Also, I certainly dont want to risk burn in problems in the future.
2) The signal sucks. Whenever I receive a phone call the phone switches back to 3G and I instantly lose internet connection. This is not sporadic and sadly happens every single time. 
I have called Apple and theyre going to replace my phone next week, so at least thats something good.

Are you guys enjoying your iPhone 12s? 
Whats your experience so far?!

Just upgraded into the 12 series. I was going to go with the 12 pro, but I also needed to upgrade my Apple Watch so, I decided to get the 128gb Red iPhone 12 with a Series 6 Red Apple Watch to go with it  I must admit Im excited. I got the 11 last time around and I was happy with it, but I usually do the yearly upgrade anyways, so figured why not? So far so good, not noticing any big differences, other than body style mostly. But I do like the look of the product red color, I was going to go blue, but I figured everyone else would have it, and I havent gone red since the 8 plus.

Im planning on keeping this phone for as long as possible so I need to make sure I choose smt i'm gonna continue to like down the line. Im planning to get a clear case to start off with because I wanna puts stuff inside it.  
Why I like each color: 

White because its safe, matches with any case or accessories, fits with anything ill put in the case, aesthetic in general lol

Blue because it's a new colour and white is a staple so there will always be a white finish but this blue might be only limited to the 12 lineup. Its not generic because most people get white, the matte sides look really good.  


Note: This will be my first ever iphone, ive only ever used android phones so im excited to switch. My thought process is that if i get white, even though its safe, i might be missing out on the new colour and that if i get blue there is a chance i wont like the colour since its a different shade in almost every photo online and ive yet to see it in person and idk if i cant guarantee that ill like blue for the next few years and its harder to match with cases n stuff. Sorry if this is too long and thank you for taking the time to read this :)

Hi everyone,

I'm on the verge of making the transition from Android to iOS (based in the UK). I think I chose a bad year, what with Apple not shipping charging bricks. I'm trying to be economical with my accessories and would ideally like a single cable that connects the phone to my macbook and 24W charging plug. My macbook only has USB-A and thunderbolt ports, and my current USB charger is also USB-A. Firstly, could I get away with just buying a single USB-C to USB-A cable? Secondly, is a 24W charger appropriate? I've read that battery life can be preserved if you only use slow charging (e.g. 5W), but I'm willing to be educated!

Thanks!

My brand new iPhone12 drains battery really fast especially at night sitting idle. 
With wifi, location, Bluetooth, mobile data off, I am losing 30-40% every night.

There is no 5g here in my country.
There is nothing that the battery stats indicate. No activity.

Apple support ran a diagnostic and didnt find anything.

I know there are many complaints on the Internet with this issue, but just wanted to know if anyone has found any workaround?

Or if iOS14.4 betas fix this issue?

This is driving me nuts, worried about the battery health in the long run.

Yesterday night before sleeping my phone was charged 78% and when I wake up after 7 hours it was 70% and it was on So I went to my nearest apple service Center. I told them the issue they did their diagnostic test and according to test everything was normal and they told me that this battery drain is normal. Is it normal or is there a problem? Can anyone please help me with this?

I dont remember this on 14.2.1 but I might be wrong as I never really tested the battery on that

So Ive read a fair bit of info on it and it sounds perfect for what I need, currently have a 8 plus and I have gotten used to the size but the thought of a smaller phone like my 5 has sold me plus other features, yeah the screens small but itll be fine for me. 

Quick question though now that its been out for a bit Ive read a lot about the battery lift and I just want to know hows the battery going for everyone now? I will be mainly leaving it in my work bag screen off with low power mode connected to my speaker at work, is it safe to say itll last about 2 hours on screen time while traveling to and from site plus another 10-12 hours playing music on my speaker? 

My 8s starting to drain to 0 halfway through my shift randomly and it is a pain in the ass since there is no possible way to charge it and listening to music helps get through the day. I dont want to have a repeat of this from the get go 

Cheers!

Hi, I got a new iPhone 12 and found it remarkable that the internal speaker seems to make some weird noises when in use: low pitched sounds in voices occasionally sound very compressed and it is almost like someone was tapping the microphone while recording. Also, the key sounds sound different from my ipad and older iPhones, but not so on headphones, they are much less distinguished and sound like mixed with some high pitched zapping/tapping in direct comparison.

I don't find a difference in that between the two internal speakers of the 12, so I wonder: is something broken, is it just due to a different technology or did I get a phone from a bad batch?  
Is anyone else experiencing the same? Does anyone know about that?

So the last I heard about this was from November last year and supposedly Apple workers were adviced to not change displays and recommend keeping phone up to date, it seems that no one is talking about it anymore tho. Whats Apple doing with this issue? How many of you are experiencing this? Does it look like a software or hardware issue? Tell me your experiences


Turns out I have this issue and since I dont really have a close store where I can just take my phone I am trying to avoid sending my phone with the shipping option as I had a really bad experience last year (2years in a row defective iPhones ). It looked like a software issue for me at first but now no one or very few people are talking about it I am wondering if maybe it would be a hardware issue

Hi all,

Recently made the switch over from the Galaxy S10 to an iPhone 12 and am loving it. Quick question about wireless charging though: I'm using my wireless charging pad I got with my Samsung Galaxy a few years ago to charge my iPhone 12. I notice, however, that the charging light on my charging pad is always showing as red, which means it's constantly charging the phone. With my Galaxy phone the light on the pad would switch to green when the phone reached 100% charged - this way it wasn't constantly dumping power into the phone when it wasn't needed. I'm wondering if I should switch wireless charger to one that regulates the charging of the iPhone 12 better? Could this charging pad that I'm using at the moment damage the battery in my iPhone 12 if it's constantly sending power into the thing? I've noticed that the back of the phone sees a little warm when I picked it off the charger when it's been sitting at 100% charged for a while... This wasn't the case with the Galaxy phone as the charger would shut off when needed.

If I should switch charger, does anyone have any recommendations?

Thanks!

Picking up an iPhone today. Ive done a ton of research on both models and theyre pretty similar. Im a college student so Im trying to make the best choice for the long-term but also financially. I definitely want 128gb of storage on the phone, and the price difference between the pro and the regular 12 would only be about $120 for me in that case. Im wondering if the price increase is worth the extra features on the pro? Im a pretty casual iPhone user. I take my photos, text my friends, and go about my day. I do, however, aim to keep this phone for a long while. I just dont want to fall for Apples stinkin consumerist price tiers so I want to be sure Im making a good choice. A better camera would be nice and maybe the extra RAM would be beneficial if Im planning on keeping the phone for a while, but Im not sure how necessary those features are (maybe they are super worth it, which is why I pose this question). Is the camera and extra RAM really going to be that much better for $120? I currently have an iPhone 8 Plus, so really any newer model would be a good upgrade. I just want to make the best decision! Anyone have thoughts on this? 

Thanks!

Im sure this has been asked a bunch of times (and Ive read through many of the posts) but I figured Id get some fresh takes. I am debating between the pacific blue and graphite 12 pro. I currently have a silver (white) X. 

Ive been set on the pacific blue since I first saw it at the Apple store. However, Ive since seen that the color of the blue looks a bit odd in clear cases and Im not sure if I would feel comfortable going caseless yet, but I dont think those two things should be deciding factors in not getting the color. The graphite also looks really slick and classy. Its a tough call, would love to hear why your chose your color, your current thoughts, and if you have any regrets.

Also case suggestions would be great as well!

1) cable and charging. Exclusion of wall plugs? And a lighting to USB c cable? Most homes I know have a USB A connector to charge up their phones. The fact that the cable came with a lighting to c is just bad. Sure if you have an Apple device like a Mac or iPad, it makes sense. But this is just too inconvenient. I had to wait for the next day just to go to a local gadget store to buy USB c wall plug. And it costed me an additional $15 for a fast charger.
Charging.... my poco has a 33w charger and going from that to a 18w charger is a big no go. Let alone those who are still holding onto iPhone 5w charger, may lord have mercy on your souls.

2) ui. You actually have to pay to get your phones to look nice. Sure, theres a way to customise your icons but its too tedious. On android you literally have to tap a button and wala..... its done. Widgets are such a pain cause I cant shift to anywhere exactly that I want on my Home Screen. Basically you cant change much which is kind of a bummer.

3) no Touch ID. I cant fathom how did apple not include this into their phones. I agree that Face ID is super fast and awesome but the fact that some payment or log ins do not support Face ID hurts cause its I have to manually type my passwords. Even with the new updates, the Face ID still couldnt pick out my face under certain masks.

4) no back button and way to kill all app in one touch. The back button on the bottom of android phones is so good that I kinda hate myself for getting an iPhone having to constantly swipe left to right overreaching my thumbs. Not to mention some of back features are located at the top left corner of the phone.

5) password and auto login. The amount of times I have to type something all over again is sickening. Why hasnt Apple implemented this when android phones have had this for so long?!

I love the small form factor and the over hardware of the phones but Jesus.... iOS really is a pain to use coming from an android user. 

It takes you 1 step to change on android as opposed to 2-3 steps to do it on iOS. Really not intuitive. Last I used an iPhone was an iPhone 6 in 2016. Its been 5 years since and I feel like Im using an iPhone 6 once again. Seriously, some of you really need to consider getting an android device over this. Im not blowing things out of proportion. I even made the leap to switch and its been like 5 days and I find it unbearable to use because of how limited this phone is. 

The work phones but its not the kind of work that youd want from a phone that cost 3x of a phone that could probably take 1 step forward instead of 2 steps backwards. Rant over

If you are in photo mode at 1x and then hit 2x, the camera doesn't automatically switch to the zoom lens. You can test this by putting your finger over the bottom lens during the switch from 1x to 2x and it is now in 2x mode but can't see your finger. Curiously, if you hold your finger over the top lens, the camera eventually moves to view out of the bottom 2x lens but it takes 5ish seconds. Also, if it's in 2x and you cover the top lens, it impacts the quality significantly. This doesn't seem to be the case in Portrait mode. Perhaps this makes the experience easier and makes for better composite photos?

I have a 12 Pro Max and a couple of days ago I ordered a Pitaka Air case off of Amazon since I wanted something that was thin and had button cutouts. Today it arrived, and for $60 I'm pretty disappointed with the way it fits. It seems like however the material was cut and formed (or whatever the process is for manufacturing things with aramid fiber) was not done consistently on both sides. The right side of the case appears to fit correctly and has a nice lip that comes over the sides of the device, but the left side has considerably less lip to it, and does not fit correctly. Here are some pictures that illustrate what I'm talking about:

[Pic 1](https://i.imgur.com/CO61elA.jpg)

[Pic 2](https://i.imgur.com/Fn1i4Jl.jpg)

You can clearly see the side band is exposed on the left side, whereas the right side appears to fit as it should. The entire left side does not fit correctly, although the top is where the defect appears most prominently. The device is pressed in firmly and the case is not bent.

Basically I'm wondering if anyone else has had quality control issues with Pitaka products. I've seen the Pitaka cases being praised on various other sides, so I'm unsure if I should try my luck on returning and ordering a new one, or just get a different case altogether. IMO this degree of inconsistency isn't acceptable on a 60 dollar product.

I am English.  Saying "Hey" to someone in England is bloody rude and I flatly refuse to say hey, even to a phone.  Unfortunately, when I tried to say "I say, Siri" or "OK, Siri" instead it didn't work.

Do I really have to choose between being rude and not using Siri?

Just upgraded to the 12 pro max. I have two wireless chargers that dont work. I know there was a update that was supposed to help and Ive also done the hard reset to no avail. One is a Logitech Powered series cradle for home use and the other is a car cradle style charger. The Logitech says not compatible with metal phone types. Fair enough. Is this a software issue still or should I look at new chargers? This is the first time I feel really fucked by Apple.

Is it just me but from day one my iPhone 12 seems to pick finger prints and smudges up easier than any other iPhone Ive had. It also seems harder to wipe them off too.
Anyone else have this? Its like the coating is pretty much gone already like when youve normally had an iPhone for like 6 months or something.

Hey there, 

So  Jan 5th   at 6:03 PM EST I got an iPhone 12 Pro Max from Tellus ( Brand new ) on contract for my business, I didn't use the phone until earlier in the afternoon on Jan 6th upon trying to charge my phone it was working I left it for about 5 mins an when I came back the charge icon was gone, I unplugged an plugged back in - still nothing. 

So I tried another cord nothing, So I tried my old one and still nothing. 

I tried all of these cords with my AirPods &amp; my iPad and all chargers work.. 

When I tried my mother's knock-off charger, The phone began to charge but only when a certain side of the knock-off charger was facing the screen. 

Does anyone know what the reason could be? It's not even 2 days old, barely used for 24 hours ... I'm so confused.
-------------------------------

I have to ask if anyone else is having problems with the corners of the screens being cut off more than on previous notch-style iPhones? Im coming from the XR and have this problem. I first noticed it when an advertisement came up on my minesweeper app and the x was cut off so I couldnt close it and had to close the app. I also noticed it when comparing the screens during Youtube videos, and on other apps. Its mainly only an issue when there are touch interfaces in the corners. I dont know if this affects a lot of apps or if anyone else is having this problem. The phones are the same size so I dont know if it has to do with the actual screen corners being shaped slightly differently or if its a result of differences in the pixels/resolutions.

Has anyone had issues with the iPhone 12 Pro crashing and not turning back on? My wife was browsing Instagram on her phone the other day (iPhone 12 Pro, 128GB, less than a month old) when it randomly crashed and turned off. When she tried to turn it back on, it just flashes the Apple logo. Ive seen this before, and have recovered from it, but a hard reboot, connecting to iTunes, DFU - none of that has worked. Took it to an Apple store and they couldnt get it to boot. So it sounds like our only option is to have Apple replace it under warranty, which is fine, but requires a $1k deposit to get a replacement until they receive the old one. 

Anyone else ever seen anything like this that DFU and even Apple cant fix?

Hey all,
I have posted here before about a scuff on the screen of my iPhone 12 PM and was asking if I return it for a new one.
I have got mixed responses and posting an image of the scuff one last time before deciding what to do by tomorrow 
The link to the image is https://ibb.co/cLv66KG

I would appreciate your insights on how serious you guys think this is. The scuff really shows when there is a bright light on it

I like all of the color options on both, but what are the differences between the two? I am leaning towards the leather cases, but Id like to hear yalls opinion on it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-01-06
So my phone fell today from about 20 cm on the floor and the case popped out on the corner so it scratched the left side of the iPhone which would have never happen if the case held the phone correctly. Plus the drop literally destroyed the leather on the top. 

I didn't expect a lot of protection but this is not good. The phone going out of the case while failing is to be expected it seems.

Take care of your iPhones leather's case holders !

I have owned my iPhone 12 Pro since launch day. Most of the time, it has given me great battery life, with screen time ranging from around 6-7 hours and lasting the whole day. But recently, all of this has changed.

As the title says, my iPhone 12 Pro is dying faster than expected. Ive lost more than 20% in over an hour, with my battery dropping from 100% to 78%. I havent been doing any intensive tasks on it. Usually, iPhones decrease their battery percentage slowly at the beginning. Theres been some instances where it stayed at 100% for many hours while using.

Yesterday, my iPhone 12 Pro died at 4PM in the afternoon. That is earlier than usual. Anyone else going through this issue? Any fixes? Please?

Personally, I tend to prefer Silver over Space Gray, so I've been tempted to go that route to match my stuff. However, I like the dark camera square on Graphite, and feel that'll probably match most cases better than a giant silver camera square.

Is Graphite noticeably different from space gray? Do you usually match all of your stuff, or go with different ones depending on the item?

Hi everyone.

I stumble across a similar thread on this forum but it's from 2 months ago so I was wondering if anyone managed to get it resolved.

Basically my wifi drops connection in a way that the wifi icon is still on, my router sees the phone as connected but there is no data being transferred. According to Apple helpline " there are no wifi issues reported on iOS 14.3". I tried everything from changing the SSID, password, disabling private addresses, wifi assist, reboots, resets, factory reset etc. and still having the same issue. It's the only device on my network that behaves like that.

Is this doable?

I noticed that my iPhone 12 gets very hot during fast charging with an original 20w Apple adapter. The temperature feels like 45-50 degrees Celsius (110-120 degrees Fahrenheit).  As far as I understand, heating will negatively affect the battery in the future. 
Is this normal or is it a defect?

I have an iPhone 12 Pro and recently applied some clear matte skins along the sides to protect the stainless steel frame, but the 2 clear cases I have do not fit. I'll slip one side in and try to push the other side, but due to the thickness of the skin, there isn't much tolerance and doesn't fit.

Any one have side skins on their 12 and using it with a case?

For Christmas I got an iPhone 12 to upgrade my Motorola power g7 (150$ cheap android) and I'm quite please with the iphone. Camera is obviously on another level, screen is great but i need to get used to the yellowish tint from the oled compared to the LCD panel from my moto. I have one complaint though. The process of downloading music on iphone is so complicated compared to the android. On android I would use youtube to mp3 website, download the song and it would appear in my native music app automatically. Boom I got the music. Now on iphone it doesn't appear directly in the music app. What's your guys way of downloading music directly to your iphones? 

Yes im too cheap to pay $5 a month for streaming services.

Also I'm getting so dragged by the matte back and the design of the 12 Pro, but I think it really isn't worth it just for that.

Hi to all. Had my iphone 12 for about a week now &amp; its a cracking phone. Have noticed sometimes when the phone has been in my pocket for a prolonged length of time, say 30 mins when I tap to wake the screen sometimes it takes a couple of taps for the screen to wake. A small issue I know but a fairly annoying one which I didnt have such an issue with my X. I have a tempered glass screen protector installed but did have one on my X also. Any help or suggestions appreciated. Cheers all.

So I came from an iPhone XR and I used to have the 2-column landscape view in Messages, Mail, Notes, Settings, and some other apps. On iPhone 12, despite having the same screen size, I don't get that view. Are you guys getting this too? Is this available on the Pro Max?
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-01-05
I just thought about it : Apple purposefully lowered the max brightness on the the 12, and could maybe be caused by this. 

If you have another idea of why this occurs, or have a good source making an investigation I am going to read it.

Ive had my iPhone 12 for about a month. Im pretty careful with my phone. Never dropped it, only take the case off at night in bed, and only goes into my pocket with nothing else in it. Lots of hairline scratches and one small but deep scratch that I can feel with my fingernail. Im not too bothered with it as it is. Light scratches dont bother me that much but it is a bit disappointing. I dont like screen protectors but Ill probably end up getting one at some point. Its bound to get scratched to shit over time without one.

I've had smartphones for 10+ years. iPhone and Android (Samsung Galaxy). In all that time, I've only ever had to replace one phone for any kinda damage...until i went back to iPhones with the 10.

Back in March (maybe FEB?), my phone fell in a hot tub. It was on the table with the towel and got knocked in. Fell down maybe three feet for less than ten seconds, hit nothing but water on the way down. By the next day, phone screen was useless. You'd think that in 2020, a phone in good condition could survive that, but whatever. Chlorine and chemicals, I get it. Paid the deductible and got the phone replaced.

Now, nine months later, I have to replace my phone again. Getting ready this AM, knocked my phone in the bathroom sink. Pulled it out, dried it off. I thought it was all on the screen since it had an otterbox with raised edges, so thought nothing of it once the phone was dry. Out and about and then while I'm standing in line getting lunch, open up Facebook (been using the phone all day, mind you) and screen gets green lines and dies, just like the last one. Threw it in rice, but im sure it's pointless now. Buttons still give feedback, but backlight is done. Guessing water got splashed on the bottom or went through some seem in the otterbox.

Now, I was already planning on upgrading to the 12 in a couple months, but now idk. I get that phones and water are not friends, but you got to be kidding me. One issue in ten years and now two issues in one year with the same phone? My galaxy 8+ that I'm writing this on (thankfully kept this as an alarm backup) went into the shower with me for music, and fell a few times. Got dropped in a river. Would take it kayakGot soaked in my pocket at my dishwashing job multiple times. And it just generally took more abuse.

I love Apple and the apple ecosystem, and so I'll probably still get the 12 bc of my apple watch and airpods, but this still annoys me. Im not asking to go diving with my phone, but its 2020. A ten second hot tub or sink drop shouldn't brick a $1000 phone. Do I need to be worried now about getting caught in the rain with my phone in my pocket now?!

I just cleaned the room with bleach (it was necessary, trust me I would have chosen some other product if I could) and theres a strong smell in the room and my phone was in the same room.
Im sure no drop has gone on the phone but of course if theres smell all around the room, I am assuming the bleach either evaporated quickly and hence spreads everywhere or something of that sort 
Should I worry about bleach evaporating off the surface and get into my iPhone? I dont wanna damage it

Hey all
I have been posting about how I was unable to decide between picking the PB or the Gold iphone 12 PM, and I ended up picking the PB and its gorgeous in person. 
Fast forward a week in a sealed box (I was busy at work and didn't even get to open it until new years eve). I set it up looked at it put it back in the box until I am free to play around with it, yesterday i picked it up and saw that it has 2 small scuffs on the bottom left lip of the frame. I was really really bummed and I have OCD so was thinking about it all day everyday until today. 
I have even contemplating returning it for a new one, however due to the lockdown there are no new shipments hence most of the shops don't have stock. I can get it shipped from my carrier but it might take time and if in time I never know what will happen to it during shipping. (I picked up my phone from the store myself).
So am I crazy for being this obsessed?? I will upload an image of the scuffs in a comment on this post later.
Should I return it? I don't mind waiting because I will go back to my note 10 which is a nice phone still. But I am worried that shipping might damage the phone and I receive a damaged unit.

Hi all! So, yeah, the title may give you some idea of what this is about, but I'm really curious about whether what I expect to happen is actually possible at this point.   


I created an automation that was triggered by location. The idea was to send a message via Whatsapp to a particular contact. The problem is when the trigger happens, it just opened the app ( WhatsApp ), opened a chat to the contact, and the intended message was pre-filled on the form. Even when I did not simulate the trigger, I got a notification saying that it has been activated with an option to "run", which did the same thing as simply opening a chat to the particular contact.   


I'm missing the last step of actually sending a message here. How do we do that?

When charging your new iPhone 12s (and the pro max) with the MagSafe charger, does the phone overheat? If so, does it give you a warning to let the iPhone cool down ?
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-01-04
Im going to puchase either of these phones and I dont care about the negligible camera improvements(not a camera person), the LCD vs OLED drama(its fine for me), the design change(i dont mind either of them), the 5g (since it isnt there in my country), magsafe( wired better) and the negligible jump in performance caused by a14 vs a13(got a gaming laptop).

Are there any more features worthy of the 200USD at this point or i could get the 11?

Hi everybody, I want to buy a new phone and I opted for the iPhone 12. My issue is that I  can't decide which colour I really want. I'm particularly interested in blue black and white.

Didi someone have the same problem? How did you solve it?

I don't want to buy a color that I would regret.

Thanks in advance for your help.

If I am using my phone outside or in a room with bright lights, it looks white. But when I am in a dull or dark room it sometimes looks yellow.

The title says it :) which one is your favorite color of the iPhone 12 (mini) and why? 

Ive ordered the black version, but due to delivery issues Im rethinking my decision and thinking of reordering the white. 

Would love to hear your opinions!

 Will I need to put my photos on the cloud or some type of account before transferring them to pc? Or is there some other way I can wirelessly transfer without using cloud, maybe using the magnet or bluetooth? I don't like the idea privacy-wise of needing to use an account to transfer.

And can the iPhone 12 (or older) also use these wireless methods to transfer photos?

Ive wanted the max from the start, i just didnt think i could wait another month till the max would be on sale since it released after the 12 pro. I was still rocking my iPhone 6s and the battery was just so bad i couldnt wait anymore. I figured the 12 Pro was the next best thing. Now, after over 3 months with the 12 Pro, i wish i had waited for the max  I wanted the bigger size since forever. oh well.... thatll teach me to be more patient next time

Bought a Magsafe Leather Wallet from Shopee (which ships from China)

Quality: 8/10 -  The leather is PU leather. i.e. not real leather but feel quite alright. Will see how long they last before they wear out. Stitching seems fine to me. 

Functionality - 9/10 - They have a magsafe ring and positioning magnet built in to the case (the listing says it is an enhanced version with double magnets).  I'm not sure if they really contain magnets or are just iron plates. (Some AliExpress sellers are now claiming that their cases have magnets built in, and don't contain iron plates). Sticks to the iPhone and also a magsafe case well. Since i don't have magnet paper, i did use another magnet to test if there is a positioning magnet (the small vertical one) below the ring, and there seems to be one there, as the magnet does attach to it. Seller did send some photos of a torn down one to show the magnets inside the wallet. (refer to photos below)

Magnet strength could be better, i could still fling it off the phone (with case) if i shook it hard enough.

All in all, a bargain for what I paid for them. I got this for USD2.75 each.

Bought a couple of HOCE branded iPhone 12 &amp; 12 Pro Leather Case with Magsafe from Lazada (which ships from China)

Quality: 8/10 - The buttons are clicky but not well finished. They're made from plastic. The leather is PU leather. i.e. not real leather but feel quite alright. Will see how long they last before they wear out.

Functionality - 9/10 - They have a magsafe ring and positioning magnet built in to the case. When paired with an original magsafe charger, the phone doesn't drop/fall off. However, since they're still considered first generation replicas, I'm not sure if they really contain magnets or are just iron plates. (Some AliExpress sellers are now claiming that their cases have magnets built in, and don't contain iron plates)

Once the phone is installed, there is a small lip which protects the phone. Cutouts are precise (speaker, lightning port and sleep-wake.

All in all, a bargain for what I paid for them. I got them for USD8.5 each.

Anybody have regrets? Its not like a deep regret but I wish I got the 12 instead of the 12 pro. I know the 12 is better but I seriously dont even take pictures and its a little heavy. I heard the 12 was more lightweight. Idk, its not necessarily a regret but I guess I wish I wouldve looked into the 12 instead of wanting the best

Firstly Happy New Year everyone!
So my question basically stands on the issue that in the camera app even when you toggle the dolby vision button you can still switch between different resolutions and frame-rates.
Currently I have my phone set to shoot 1080 30fps and the Dolby Vision button on. How do I know if it is actually switched on or not.
Cause I can also have my phone shooting 1080 60fps or 4k 60fps (standard models cant shoot dolby in 60fps) and the Dolby vision button still stays turned on.

Thanks in advance!

Is it a worth buy ? It costs around 220 MYR in my currency, which considering the price tag, it's quite hefty. That said, I fell in love with the looks / grip / quality of it. But I've also heard reviews that the durability is really bad, and it's not worth the price tag, how true is this to an extend ?

I'm about to place my money straight into the Silicone Case, but I have doubts about the durability, I am someone that takes really good care of my things, and very careful if I want to, with that said, would this Silicone Case be for me ? Or should I just opt for the leather case instead ?

Hi guys, I have an 12PM Graphite and I cant decide on my magsafe case and wallet combo. 
Could u post yours :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-01-03
I got the 12 on Christmas day- upgraded from a Galaxy s6. I've had severe headaches and eye strain every day since- and I have never struggled with headaches in the past. I feel like an absolute lunatic saying it's my phone, but I can't find any other probable cause. It didn't even occur to me until about 2 days ago.  
I've tried reducing the white point by 95-100% and turning the brightness all the way up to get rid of the flicker, but I still have a low grade headache. I didn't pick up my phone once yesterday- and no headache.... but I can't help but wonder if that is a coincidence or maybe even a placebo of sorts.  
I have an eye appointment (I've always had good vision and haven't struggled with my computer or reading or anything, but it seemed a good idea anyway)- but I won't be able to go before my return date is over.  
I really don't want to return this phone and go for the 11.... But I cannot live with these headaches. Is it really the OLED? Or am I acting crazy? Is there anything else I can do?

Does anyone know if something like this exists with a Magsafe connection instead of an adhesive? I'm trying to ditch my standalone wallet and  attach something to my 12 mini instead but I don't want everything to have to go into one pocket like it does with Apple's Magsafe wallet. I thought there'd be more things out there but all I've seen are a bunch of clones of Apple's wallet (plus that one from Moft that doubles as a stand) but I really want something like this or just 3 stacked pockets.

Whether or not you are aware of these current issues the displays are having, please check these issues as you might still have the chance to sort out these issues if you were not aware.. I will explain how to check each thing. And if you dont have any issues please comment if your iPhone is new or a replaced model.

\- green tones (check by turning brightness at 0% in dark mode , go to the settings and se if the grey colors have a green shade)

\- flickering (check by going to any youtube video that says 'black screen', decrease the brightness at 0% and put youtube in horizontal view and see if the black sides flash or flicker while watching it)

\- Blacks not being blacks (go to google, type in 'pure black image', save it, go to images and open the pic, reduce the brightness to 0%, zoom in and see if the screen is really off when viewing the image or you see the screen turned on and its like a dark grey rather than black as black colors on these iPhones should be as if the screen is off)

Ive had my phone for about 6 months but over the past 3 days the WiFi connection on my phone has been frustratingly slow. I know its the phone because all of my other devices are fine. 

Ive found plenty of other posts around the internet complaining of the same issue but no solutions. Ive tried a hard reboot and forgetting my home network and reconnecting.

Hey guys, it looks to me that the battery draining issue while idle seems to be happening only if I leave my wi-fi turned on. Mobile data does not seem to play any major role, so you can leave that on.  


Can those of you who have experienced this try turning the wifi off for the night and see if it helps you as well?  


Thanks!

First iPhone 12 PM was a pre-order and I had the flickering issue (on youtube videos with black screens) and blacks not being blacks on still images, so I returned it.

Second iPhone 12 PM (replacement) has the following:

\- the screen seems to be more yellow toned than the previous one, but this might be untrue and I might be only saying it because with the previous one I didn't seem to be bothered by it or notice it whereas this one I noticed it quite instantly

\- at 0% brightness the greys (for example in 'settings' there is a lot of grey) are very green toned, again this is something I didn't notice with my previous one but this green hue tone seems to be only at 0% brightness, as I raise it the problem seems to be going away or reduce at least

\- at 0% the blacks are not black most of the time (steady images or videos) rather they have some sort of greyish light in the middle of the screen vertically, which clearly shows that the screen is not off, however at raising the brightness the problem solves and the blacks are indeed black

\- in  the oled panel test, using a grey image at low brightness in a dark room I can see the oled panel is not as uniform (although expected from an oled panel), which shows a darker shade on the top half and a greenish lighter shade on the bottom half, whereas the previous one had a perfect uniform oled panel with no lighter or darker sides

&amp;#x200B;

I am very happy with my iPhone and the issues I am encountering are only under certain conditions, except the yellow toned display but at this point I am assuming apple decided to make it this way, whereas the green tones and blacks not being blacks might be something related with the implementation of magnets that interfere with the panel (maybe?) as others have suggested.

Before I proceed with any decisions in this matter, I am once again asking for people that don't have any issues of this sort and think their iPhone is perfect to please comment below as getting it replaced again and again has no point if everyone has some sort of issues.

So as the title says it overheats when charging, so much so that I have to keep a mini fan on my phone to keep it cool. My extension cord overheats A LOT as well. This is worrying me I dont want to have my iPhone 12 explode, or some freak accident to happen when Im asleep. I am thinking of buying a Apple power adapter, maybe a 18w, since I think the 20w might be too strong. I would love any advice or experiences you have in this situation. Thank you.

If anyone wants Ill post some photos taken with the 12 and compare it to other phones if you want (note 20 ultra and iPhone 11) I did some comparisons with the iPhone 11 and 12 and nearly every time I feel like the 11 looks better but not totally sure

Just bought an iPhone 12 and I'm really trying to go all out with preserving the integrity of the battery and using the phone long-term. I have a non-magsafe case and I don't really care for the wireless charging, but I'm wondering whether the choice of charging brick would make a difference on preserving battery health? Should I use the old USB-A Apple brick or the higher wattage USB-C that came with my Pixel? I'm pretty sure the 18W will charge faster, but would the Apple-made brick be better for the battery health?

I just got the iPhone 12 red, as a very unexpected gift from my dad on Christmas Eve. 
He bought it directly from Apple.

Ive only had it a couple day and I noticed it gets quite hot when charging. From low battery to 50 percent was really hot. 

Im wondering if this is something I need to mention to Apple or just leave it be and deal either it. I have small children and dont want a fire. 
Im struggling as it is, grieving my mothers death and losing all my belongings would be the fucking cherry on top of a bad sundae. 


Just making sure its ok or what others would do. 
I did search the issue and see it a few times for the pro series, but not many details on what they did about it.

I understand that the iPhones are very sturdy devices and that the water resistance provides a lot of protection over such things but I am curious anyway, I sleep and spend most of time (due to covid) in a very tiny room (dont think its bigger than 3x4 metres) and the window glass gets quite wet due to condensation.. its about -2 degrees Celsius out there and its relatively warm inside.. I sleep with my head close to the windows and its by the window where I put my phone over night; the iPhone is always dry (I might see a slight fingerprint that seems wet but quickly evaporates, only happens when I pick up the iPhone and touch the screen) and so are dry other surfaces inside the room, the condensation is just on the window. Does this mean that my room is very humid and I am perhaps damaging my iPhone due to water damage (high humidity)? Water damage is one of the most unpredictable things that happen in the most unexpected things so I am indeed worried.. I am contemplating getting apple care for this purpose only, DO YOU GUYS HAVE WINDOW CONDENSATIONS IN YOUR ROOM?

There is condensation on every window of this house, so theres not really an escape and knowing that everyone in this season has condensation would make sense

Hi, I have just received a 12 pro max and my mother received a 12, we are both using otterbox cases. Me a defender pro, and she is using a defender. She got her phone and case a few days ago and I realized qi charging was iffy for her and only worked after 3 or 4 tries. I got my phone today and tried all 3 qi chargers in my house and none worked after several tries. The 2 with LEDs both shown that it recognized a device but it didnt have qi charging. Both phones worked fine on qi pads before the cases. Ive always used otterbox defenders and on my previous Xs and 8 plus both were qi charged every night in an otterbox defender. Also, the cases box literally says supports qi charging

Apple tech had me update from iOS 14.2.1 to 14.3 and it fixed the issue. Great product otherwise.

Looking for the most durable iPhone 12 case possible - I've switched between Lifeproof cases and Otterbox defenders for my iPhone 6 over the last ~5 years, and would prefer cases with built in screen protectors though they seem to have gone out of style. What's the current recommendation?

Coming from an SE 2020 &amp; comparing it side-by-side to the 12 mini I just got, I realize that even though the screen on the 12 mini is bigger, it actually shows LESS on screen. The SE 2020 shows more of a zoomed view of things, while on the 12 mini, it's like everything is zoomed out, maybe cuz of the aspect ratio or something. But then on Safari, everything looks zoomed IN? Do you guys just get used to this, will app developers adjust to make things look "normal" on the 12 mini screen with time, or what? Idk which phone to keep at this point!

There are so many different cases to choose
Matte case which looks cool and touch good;
Transparent case which can give your phone a original color on best way but maybe turn to yellow after you use the case a long time ;
Silicone case touch good ;
Leather case will be easier to use because you can always use as a wallet
anyone can tell me what's case you got for your iPhone 12?

Hello. I have a 12 Pro on the way and I'm looking to replace my old CD slot car mount with something that works with Magsafe. [This](https://www.amazon.com/Magnetic-Universal-Cradle-Less-Magentic-Powerful/dp/B07QCWYLFK/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=magsafe+cd+car+mount&amp;qid=1609295381&amp;sr=8-4) looks interesting but it looks like I'll still have to charge with a lightning cable. Does anyone know of a mount that has a Magsafe charger built in? Is that even a thing?

Thanks.

I'm pretty torn atm on whether or not I should upgrade to the iPhone 12 from the Galaxy S10+ so looking for some honest opinions on whether I should go for it or just hold out.

I switched to android back when the S7 edge was released as I wasnt a fan of the IPhone 6 at the time and the additional android features appealed to me more. After that I went from the S7 to S8 then jumped to the S10+ when that was released. Since the recent IOS 13/14 releases they have added quite a few things that appeal to me which were lacking previously, the reason I jumped ship at the time. Home screen customisation, attaching external hard drives to the phone, being able to connect controllers etc. 

One thing I do miss about IOS is its overall simplistic look. Its very easy to use, is relatively smooth and just looks good. The android os feels very messy to me, I'm not a fan of how they create shortcuts and the actual app itself, it means I have to organise essentially two separate screens so they both look neat whereas with ios its all together. 

Another big factor to me is imessage, facetime etc. Most of my friends and family have an iPhone so I usually just message them over messenger or WhatsApp which is fine but it would be easier to just do it within imessage under one 'app' rather than multiple. I also have a daughter who i video call regularly and just being able to jump into facetime rather than messenger or WhatsApp would be easier. 

One thing I'm not a fan of however is the iPhone 12 still has that massive notch at the top. The screen also runs at 60hz whereas the s10 has a higher refresh rate. Ive read the notch on the 13 will be smaller and the phone itself will have a higher refresh rate so I am debating going waiting for the 13 but that is just speculation. Im not exactly in any rush to change phone but im getting bored with the s10 and would much prefer a smoother, all-in-one experience. Ive also found a pretty good deal which bundles the iPhone with the latest apple watch, still works out at a cheaper monthly payment than what im paying now but not much. 

I've got till March 2022 until my current contract runs out so I could pay it off now, make the money back by selling the phone and upgrade or hold out to the 13 later in 2021. What would you suggest?

Hey everyone
I am a first time iPhone user, came from an Android. So I bought myself a pacific blue iphone 12 pro max and its glorious, however, I keep seeing the graphite black more appealing but maybe because I have never owned one before.
What are your thoughts should I keep it or exchange it? I still have 7 more days in the exchange window 
I need your input on which color is sexier and what not

Thanks

Hi, soon I will replace my Iphone 6s with Iphone 12 Pro Max. However I am confused to decide which color is right for me. After I read a lot and saw some reviews, I thought Gold would be my choice, but does Gold really have better durability and quality than the other 3 colors that the iPhone 12 Pro Max has ? I have a source of info like [this post](https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/review-iphone-12-and-iphone-12-pro-two-gems-one-jewel/) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRW1YZeSnNk&amp;feature=youtu.be), but I'm not sure if it's true in real life. Maybe someone already has a Gold color and can share their experiences ?

Hey all,

I bought an Apple MagSafe Leather case in Baltic blue for my iPhone 12 Pro. Alongside it, I also bought the MagSafe wallet. After only about a day or two I noticed some wear on the case, specifically in the same general area/shape of the MagSafe wallets corners. 

Now I know cases are supposed to patina over time (Ive had my forest green leather case on my XS since I got the phone, its practically black now), but after only a few days of use, I started to question whether this is normal. I filed for an exchange with Amazon, and my new one should be coming in tomorrow. Wondering if it was worth swapping it out for the new one, or if I should just stick with the one I have.

If anyone has had a similar experience, Id love to hear about it!

So I currently own an Anker Powerport Mini 12w charger (6w if youll use both ports) and will upgrade to the 12 from the 6S.

I dont care about fast charging and just want to keep the battery life for as long as possible (see my current phone) and Im always home anyway or have a powerbank with me when I used to go out before COVID so it never appealed to me. I always charge my phone overnight and do short charges here and there throughout the day, so should I get the 5w charger, or is it okay to stick with my 12w charger?

I know that the phone is smart enough to only get what it needs, Im just concerned if the phone will heat up because itll fast charge with the 12w.

I was wondering if anyones used any external lenses with the 12. Could those potentially help with the ghosting/lens reflections?

I always just use 1 case the day I get the phone. For the past 4 years Ive been only using speck brand case. Specifically their glitter clear case. Its the only case I like because its super smooth. I see some people having multiple cases and I just dont see the appeal. Its one and done for me kinda becomes a part of the phone. I guess Id get a new one if it got unusable damaged. But I just leave it on forever until I upgrade. Anyone else? Also what case are you using right now. 

My favorite case, tried and true ride or die best case that exists IMO https://www.speckproducts.com/apple/iphone-cases/iphone-12-iphone-12-pro-cases/presidio-perfect-clear-glitter-iphone-12-iphone-12-pro-cases/IPX20-PP-CLR-GL.html#start=8

Like many others, my iPhone 12 Pro also doesnt properly turn off pixels when displaying black at a low brightness. However, I didnt have the flicker issue. That changed when I updated to iOS 14.3.

So, is it just a bug instead of a hardware issue? Searching for an answer, I started to play around with various settings to see if I can influence the flickering. Turns out I can.

I used \[this YouTube video\]([https://youtu.be/aXHcRiSK\_ys](https://youtu.be/aXHcRiSK_ys)) because it consistently produces the flickering issue.

The starting conditions: 

* True Tone: off 
* Night Shift: off 
* Auto brightness: off
* Brightness set to roughly 25%

Without a color filter the whole display flickers. It turns on (faint grey glow) and off with a frequency of about 1 Hz or slightly higher.

But with a blue/yellow color filter the part of the display that plays the video stays permanently on and shows the typical faint grey glow. Now only the surrounding letterbox flickers. This does not happen with any other color filter.

Here are a few more strange findings. With the blue/yellow filter still on:

* Turning on only True Tone or only Night Shift doesnt change the behavior. The screen stays on and only the letterbox flickers. But turning them both on at the same time causes the entire screen to flicker, like it does without a color filter.
* Starting a screen recording also causes the whole screen to flicker, but with a lower frequency.
* Reducing the white point causes the entire screen to flicker too.

Can anyone reproduce this?

I was using apple silicone case, but the case attracts a lot of dust particles and becomes difficult to keep the phone clean. So got a Spigen case along with a tempered glass. My car doesnt support wireless apple car play so one Lightning to USB A cable for that.

Case looks super cool, fits perfectly and solid as well.
Spigen GLAStR Tempered glass installation is super easy and gets aligned perfectly with zero bubbles. Im happy with the purchase. :)

Hello everybody, I need your help.

Few weeks ago I wanted to buy iPhone SE 2020 and said F it, and went and ordered iPhone 12 last week. Last night I was checking my carrier website and saw they got mini in their lineup. Im coming from Samsung A5 2017 which has same body size as regular 12. I have relatively small hands and thought mini would be great for me, but there's few questions I have.

1) Im almost all the time on my phone checking whatsapp and instagram, and watching youtube. Will battery on mini version be the issue ?

2) Text size on mini, is it too hard to read it ?

3) Did anybody returned their mini for the regular 12, and if so, why ?

Hello, 

I have an Iphone 12 (productRed, if that matters), and getting only around 6 hrs screen on time (wifi mostly, 10% 4G) from 100% to 5%. Do I have a lemon? Any input would be great. Thanks!
-------------------------------

Before I begin, want to clarify few things. Yes, I have turned off true tone and night shift. Yes, I've even got a replacement. No, I'm not obsessing over a tiny detail, this is in fact a real issue for many.

The new iPhones do have a warmer tint. The whites are not completely white, there is a yellow tint. I got a 12 recently, and I have switched over from a oneplus 5T, so I'm not a stranger to OLEDs. I straightaway found this a little off and asked for a replacement. While I waited for it to arrive, I looked around for the reported issues.

Some are definitely manufacturing defects. One of them is [the green flicker issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/iPhone12/comments/kjtcws/screen_flicker_updates/). I suggest you get a replacement ASAP in that case. Blacks should be truly black at all brightness levels. Playing [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjWfY7SnMBI&amp;feature=youtu.be) in a dark room with varying levels of brightness can help you reproduce that. I tried it out with both my 12 and my old 5T and they both worked fine here. Though in both phones, if you bring up the white volume bar on the black video, you can see a very small halo around the bars. But if your screen flickers or something is amiss, please consider replacing it. I also read about some battery issues, and while I can't comment on 5G as its not here in my country, the performance has been great. If you do have battery issue, again consider getting a replacement.

Which now brings me back to my original issue.  I found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/iPhone12/comments/jy8wu0/apple_senior_advisor_update_iphone_12_yellowing/), which TLDR, is that all new 12s are calibrated to have a warmer display. I soon got a replacement and that was yellow too. I went around some apple stores in my city, and a friend of mine in New Delhi did the same, and we both found that ALL display 12s were tinted yellow. So yeah, **iPhones being tinted yellow by default is a thing**.

 There are some people who like this, and well, that's awesome. But having a warmer display makes a little shifty. In dark mode, you can see the whites aren't white. In light mode, the screen does look noticeably warmer. If you take a picture, the whites do look a little yellowish and if you say airdrop it too your mac, you can see the colors looking normal again on it. Also t[his has happened in the past too](https://www.reddit.com/r/iPhone11Pro/comments/fnmoqx/iphone_11_pro_display_bright_more_yellow_compared/). There are color filter workarounds, but. honestly they don't seem to do the trick for me.

So now I have two options, return the iPhone for good and look for either older iPhones (which may or may not be a good idea), or go back to Android (which personally I don't want to). Any suggestions?

Why is 10% of my battery going to photo background usage? I use icloud photo storage but does that mean its constantly in use? also if I turn off icloud photo storage will I lose my 90 gb of photos in my icloud? just want my new 12 pro to be running as best as possible.

Question above

I am torn between either purchasing the I phone 12 or 12 pro. I plan on buying a phone and using it right until Apple doesnt support it (about 5 years). I would save about $230 (Canadian) if I got the regular 12, but Im afraid if I decide to do that and save the $230 I may be sacrificing future performance as the 12 pro has the slightly better camera and an extra 2GB of RAM. I dont want to spend the extra $230 if I dont need too but I want to make sure I wont regret it, especially in a few years time. Does anyone know if the 2GB of RAM or slightly better Pro camera will be any more beneficial in 5 years, or should I just go with the 12? 

Also would 128GB be enough storage, for either model? Does the 12 Pro system take up more storage than the regular 12? I save my photos to the cloud but I like to keep my music on my phone (about 6GB right now).

I've been switching in between iPhone and android for the past 8 years and finally made the switch to android permanently 4 years ago. There's a lot that I could on android than the iPhone but I have to admit, I do miss ios simplicity and usability of the phone. It feels nice in the hand. So currently I'm using a poco f2 pro which is of course the budget 5g 865 snapdragon oled phone you can ever find on the market. Even comes with a headphone jack.

So just awhile ago, my brother asked if he could buy the phone off me and for some reason, my telco informed me of a recontacting. Essentially I get $100 off on an iPhone mini while maintaining the same plan. It costs $1200 for a 128gb iPhone 12 mini and $500 for the poco f2 pro. Then again, if I were to upgrade it to an android. Phone, the mi10t pro comes to mind. Good camera, good battery, good chipset and a 144 hz display.

So it boils down to whether to go back to ios or stick with android. Honestly os isn't the main concern.

But just the phones alone, I feel that the mi10t pro is the much better device. Battery will last for 2 days with heavy use, big 144 hz screen, 865 chipset blazing speeds, one of it not the best mid to high tier camera quality phones, fast charging and of course cheaper by a quarter of the price from an iPhone.

Like the only reason why I'm considering an iPhone 12 mini is the small size factor and the latest bionic chipset which I've seen out perform some phones with snapdragon 865 chipsets. Everything else is okay.

So which should I go for? If you can convince me the 12 mini is better, I'd definitely go for it. Casing and other stuff would be a breeze source for. Aka more options.

Hi guys!  I have an annoying problem with my iPhone 12. Basically, after about a week of use, when I take a photo, the camera application crashes not allowing me to take any photos.  However, restarting the device the camera starts to work.  But just wait a few days and the problem returns.  In your opinion, is it a hardware or software problem?

Hello all!I am a Xiaomi Mi9T Pro user here (turning 1 year today with this phone) and I must say that it is actually a beast in everything.I have a custom ROM too (stock Android 11).Its a dream actually now!BUT i woke up now at 3:00am and I was thinking of getting the 12 mini...then I thought maybe its not the size it suits my hands and maybe the battery I am used to on my Xiaomi will not live up to the expectation.So I said maybe i would go 1 year back..to the 11 64gb.Sounded more safe at tge same price here.(My brother has it and I could use it a bit and see how it is,i took pictures,i did some things anyway.it was nice).Then I was watching videos again on 12 v 11... And all of a sudden I stumbled upon the decision for the 12 64gb for a couple of reasons.it is a bit pricey tho..Right now my wallet CAN ABSOLUTELY afford it actually!But i was just thinking it was too muxh for a damn phone.Welll...Guess Ill go for it tho  as i made some calculations for my financial situation (whatever it suppose to mean) in a span of 3 to 4 months and the results will be very good as i will do a money depreciation (also I dont have any financial obligations at this time.Just living the dream ..for now..).Anyway. XIAOMI USER GOES TO THE APPLE iPHONE 12 VERSE!!!

I noticed that sometimes the camera just wont focus and shifts in and out till it stops when the picture ist still blurry.
I had my first iphone 12 pro replaced for that reason and the second one gets the same issue.

It just happens some times and i think since i use a flip cover i can force it when i start the camera app when the cover is on the backside over the lens. It seems the focus catches the cover when i remove it and after that it gets problems to re-focus.

Since it hapens to more then one phone i believe in a software problem.

Anyone noticed somthing like that?

Sorry for my bad english.

My brand new IPhone 12 has these gaps on three sides, large enough to fit a piece of paper in them. I encountered a similar issue with my IPad Pro 12.9 and it seems like it is a common problem with the boxier design. Does anyone else have the same issue? It sucks because it accumulates dust and could possibly have an impact on water-proofness. It Is a bit disappointing, considering the price tag.

Any updates on the gray green screen flickering? Its ridiculous that this is even an issue.

Easy way to test for it. Go to settings -&gt; wallpaper -&gt; choose a new wallpaper -&gt; stills -&gt; scroll all the way down and choose the pure black at the end. Now in the wallpaper preview, the flicker is present in any low light condition. The screen will be black (pixels off) then intermittently flash very light gray or green.

Its subtle until you notice it, then it really stands out. This also has a negative impact on battery life, since OLED screens can conserve battery by turning off pixels to display blacks.

If you happen to see this post, could you test it out and respond with the results? I want to approximate what % of displays its affecting. Apple claims its a software issue, so shouldnt it affect all phones? Have a 12 pro btw.

The camera on my brand new iPhone 12 from Apple wont work when I open it it just shows black screen. I switched between camera and video even switched between front and back and opened and closed the app, only on the 3rd or 4th try will it sometimes work and other times it wont work at all or it will work right away. Any one else having this very ultra annoying issue? 

Side note, the phone wasnt shipped I picked it up from my local Apple dealer. And its had the issue since day 1 aka 2 days now.

Just got the iPhone 12 after using iPhone 6s for years. Im impressed by how light and thin the 12 is compared to the 11, with slightly better specs and hardware. The battery life is amazing and lasts me the whole day. I feel like I can finally enjoy the full iPhone experience without having to optimize everything for battery life.

But Im not sure if its worth the full price since I mostly use my phone for safari, reddit, discord, and taking pictures/videos sometimes. Should I get SE with Apple watch instead? I run/bike frequently too and Im not sure which would be more suitable for that.

Is it drastic? I am sure screen (non-issue screens) has a major step up. But how is your experience with the battery life? Is it the same or better or worse. Any other points you would like to reflect upon?

Hi everyone, I am writing this post since I would like to know your thoughts about my actual situation. 

I have an android phone but I would like to buy a new iPhone 12. However, I do not know whether or not it would be beneficial to buy one knowing I would go from 256GB of storage to a 128GB iPhone (it is the one I am willing to spend my money on). My actual phone is still very good and fast but I would like to switch to an iPhone because of the camera, the OS, and the integration with the Apple ecosystem.  Considering all this, should I still consider buying the new iPhone? I have also read about some battery draining issues the new iPhones are experiencing and I would like to know if some of you had those issues.

Hello everyone,

I am in dire need of upgraded my phone. I have an iPhone 7. I already find the iPhone 7 heavy and cumbersome to hold (woman with small hands).  However, i have become accustomed to it. iPhone 12 Max is well out of my hand range and I cant handle the weight. I believe the camera is the same on the 12 mini and 12.

In your opinion is the camera worth the extra size and weight of iPhone 12 pro? Which phone should I buy?

I use my phone for FaceTime, calls, texts, and watching YouTube. 

I would like a nice camera to shoot photos of my art that I plan to sell online. 

I use clutched and small purses and prefer a smaller phone.

 Hello. I just switched to the iPhone 12 and I want to know what the "default" timer setting was. As in, what is the pre-set timer on the Clock app if I never changed it?

Every time I go back to the clock app, it shows my previous time. For example, if I set a timer for 9 minutes, when I go back to the app, the new "default" timer is 9 minutes.

It sounds dumb, but I essentially just want to know what the pre-set timer is at the very beginning. I could figure it out if I reset my iphone, but I don't want to do that right now so I was hoping someone else could help.

If someone has recently reset their phone (or got a new phone) and hasn't started a timer, could you let me know what it is?

&amp;#x200B;

I know it sounds dumb, but it's this OCD thing I have.

Thank you!

I have had a 12 Pro since release day.  I bought a Aothing Qi charger that has the magnets and 15W charging and it has worked since I got it 11/29 until about a week ago.  Now the phone no longer charges on it, although shows the lightning bolt and says it is charging.  The puck will charge my airpod pros just fine and I even threw an out of service Samsung S7 on it and it fast charged that.  I talked with Apple Support and they suggested re-installing iOS 14.3 from iTunes.  I tried that and it hosed the phone and I had to buy some software to get the OS installed and restore my phone from backup because of the corruption from the iTunes install failures.  It still will not charge wirelessly.  The problem did not start right after the 14.3 update as far as I remember but shortly after.  It charges just fine with a cable.  

Anyone else have this issue or any ideas of what to try next.  Or should I just wait for the next iOS update and hope it fixes it.

I know its IP68 rated, but not sure if I should do anything. Out for a meal, waiter spills champagne on me, phone was in my hand but it got splashed. It wasnt submerged but there was liquid on the case and some on the screen (screen protector), I dont think any would have entered the charging port or speakers as I was holding the phone up, but cant be sure.

Is it likely that kind of spill could cause an issue - its alcohol and not fresh water, hence me asking this question. If it was water I wouldnt be too bothered.

So I got my iPhone 12 and it's perfect except one thing that really annoys me, when on vibrate (all the time for me) you can't feel or hear it, my old 4 years old iPhone (doesn't have haptic feedback) used to shake the entire table when I got a message and even wake me up in the middle of the night from the noise of the vibration, but my iPhone 12 doesn't even feel like it's vibrating even when calling me, it's so annoying, I've missed so many calls and messages and other important notifications because of it, and even when I put it in my pocket I can't feel when someone's calling me...

My question is if this low/weak vibration is something normal?

I think the 12 pro this year is a bit too big for me. The 11pro was the perfect size IMO. I can still hold it comfortably with a case. 12/pro version is good without a case but when you have a case on it really start to get into the big phone category. The mini is a great size and should remain that way but the 12/pro could be a bit smaller ...

So since I'm way tired of Samsung way of dealing with things, I'm considering switching to Iphone for good. I have a S20 ultra atm and I'd like to buy an Iphone 12 pro max.

This is especially a question for those users who switched to Iphone after using Android and Samsung all the time before: what do you miss the most? And what makes you happy about the switch? I can't just try an Iphone12 and then go back to the Ultra in case I don't like it, since I'll sell the Ultra, so I'd really like to know what i'd probably expect from the chage. Thank you!

I've had the iPhone 12 with the Silicone Case from Apple since the start of November. The case attracts dust like no other case I've ever had. Is it something to do with this case being 'magnetic'? This is my only thought. Had multiple silicone and leather cases for previous iPhones and never had this issue. Apple Support don't really care when I questioned it. Anyone else experienced this?

Will sell this case and look for a new one. Does anyone have any suggestions? Preferably leather. Love the Bellroy designs but trustpilot reviews and Amazon reviews put me off.

Hey guys,

I am teying to find a good case for the 12 Pro Max. Currently have a Spigen Liquid Air on the 11 and it served me great but the edges are a bit sharp.

Does the new silicone one by Apple wear quickly? The leather one might be a good choice then.

I am also considering the Clear Ultra Hybrid by Spigen but worried it will yellow.

So, I'll be owning my first iPhone in a couple of days. However, this is not my first iDevice, but it has been years since I messed with iOS; I used to make themes for jailbroken devices on iOS versions 3/4-6/7.

What's the first things I should do after setup? Any "must-have" apps/widgets?

Hi there!

So I bought my new iPhone 12 Pro this week and Ive seen that in areas that are supposed to be black (for example the software update menu in Settings or my wallpaper, which is mostly black) I can see a somewhat faint green tint to the black, which turns completely black after a few seconds. It happens while turning on (i.e. on the Apple logo screen) or while watching movies.

Have any of you experienced this? Have you found a fix for it? Ive contacted Apple and they told me to wait.

Thanks a lot!

Having upgraded from the iPhone X around a month ago, I was obviously expecting a good amount of difference in day to day use as this is a device thats 3 years newer with a faster processor and everything etc.

Dont get me wrong, theres certain aspects that are night and day like the cameras and battery (although my X was on 78% battery health at the end) but performance wise it just doesnt seem optimised at all to me. By no exaggeration, it runs basically identical to the X and by that I mean stutters, half a second lags when brining down the control centre, overheating occasionally although rare etc. And just not as smooth as you would think is what Im trying to get at.

For a device thats 3 years old Ive somewhat become accustomed to it but a brand new iPhone that came out 2 months ago having this sort of performance is really underwhelming. Is it just not optimised properly with the extra power? Ive had apps that ran fine of the X heat up the 12 so much that I just didnt bother with it anymore.

If it was an optimising problem or something software related thats somewhat understandable although theyve had more than enough time to sort it out by now. I use my phone normally throughout the day not light not super heavy but either way even if I was it shouldnt impact the phone in this way.

It shouldnt have anywhere near the same performance as the X and definitely not worse in some aspects. Give it time or was I expecting too much from this upgrade? Not that I can return the phone anymore since its past the return period

a tight case on the iPhone with the added skin is like sitting on an iPhone constantly, or a, I just overthinking? I am planning on keeping this phone for as long as possible so im not trying to break it
-------------------------------

Ive got a 12 pro and I refuse to put a case on it. I want to put some kind of skin on the edges to make the fingerprints less noticeable. What do you degenerates have in mind?

just trying to see what cases are safe to do this with, so if you have any you use daily with the skin pls pop the name of the case in the comments

So I bought Apple care (on monthly installments) and I have a few questions.

1. What if in first year I didn't brake device or didn't break the screen? Do I have to pay for second year again or no?
2. If I break one time screen and after couple of months I break again and after a year (that's all in 12 months) my phone is destroyed and totally unusable... would I get a new (refurbished one) or not. If I'm correct there are two screen replacement and one phone replacement?

Been with Apple even before the iPhone, iPad, iPod , MacBook, etc.

And I am not here to through shade on the company or products. Just my opinion; but man am I bored... The phones, to me is a refab of a great piece of hardware years back. True, better processing power, cameras, etc. But really it is kind of a snooze fest.

They used to innovate leaps and bounds. Maybe it's all been done now. But this phone, the issues, the locked down operating system; referring to just having the ability to customize look and feel, has become a boring experience. 

iOS 14.x is just - I don't know... MEEHHHH. The 'app library' is a joke and I don't care for how Apple decides for me. And yes I am quite aware that "I don't have to scroll over to that page". Which is really a lame way of ignoring the fact, you really can't customize your phone.

Of course we can jump through hoops and use Shortcuts to make it appear customizable. But what a song and dance just to add different icons. 

Don't some of you feel like the garden is getting more and more restrictive? Do you think Apple listens to us about what we want anymore? 

Other parts of the ecosystem is great,  Privacy! But then, is it privacy from others and for Apples eyes only? How do we really know. Yes, others are worse about our privacy. I get that.

And yes, I know there are other choices, other OS, other hardware.

When comparing my 12 Pro to someone elses 11 side by side (both screens are 6.1) I noticed that the corners of the 12 Pro appear slightly more rounded, there is a bit more space above the notch corners, and the notch looks slightly different but I cant put my finger on it. Does anyone else who have an older Face ID iPhone notice a difference?

Hi all,

Ive only had my XR a year however I am tempted to early upgrade to a 12 or 12 Pro! 

My XR is currently 94% battery health, always on battery saver but other than that no major problems other than boredom! 

Is the upgrade worth it (itll be around 400 for me to upgrade + 10 more a month) 

If so, what one is better? The 12 or 12 pro? 

I am tempted by the 12 pro because I LOVE the gold! 

Let me know your opinions!



Thanks

Hello, I'm looking at iPhone 12 cases and found a Mous limitless 3.0 case that has magnets on the back. I am worried that the magents on the Mous case will mess with the camera of iPhone 12's, or possibly the magnets inside the iPhone 12 too. Because, Apple has said in the past to avoid an Apple accessories with cases because it can ruin the camera. Which has something in them that is sensitive to magnets. If anyone has any experience with the Mous case on the 12. I'd love to hear how it's holding up, and if you have been experiencing any issues.

Bought my Iphone 12 a few days ago because I got tired trying to sync my iPad notes/finding a notetaking app that syncs to my Ipad, PC and my Android phone. Wanted to give the Apple ecosystem a try.

And man, I love it so much and am impressed by it! It's my first time using Apple iPhone and didn't know that it can even sync photos, videos, calendars, reminders across both devices so well. I'm now even more inspired to write reminders and plan my life out because of how easy it is to keep track. I'm sold to this ecosystem and probably won't turn back. HAHA. 

The irony of this photo is that I took it with my old Huawei. Blurry photo :P

I just got the iPhone 12 and want a pretty durable, but not overly thick case and am willing to spend a bit of money to get one.

I've basically narrowed it down to the Mous Limitless 3.0 speckled cloth and the Dbrand Grip with the concrete skin. I like a rougher (sandstone) feel on the back and am hoping these styles have what I'm looking for. Anyone have any experience with these cases, or their textures? 

Any other case suggestions are also welcome, thanks!

Recently purchased a new iPhone 12 and I'm loving it so far! I do have an Ipad Pro with an Apple pencil. I am aware that iPhone doesn't have a stylus.. but are there any 3rd party ones that are compatible with it? I just love the Apple Pencil experience and would love it if I can have the same thing for iPhones.   


Previously an Android user so am still getting use to apple products. But so far, the ecosystem is amazing! Everything syncs so well!

So this is my first OLED iPhone, I moved from an XR. I noticed right off the bat that the display seems a bit warmer than on the XR, both with True Tone enabled (sadly didn't get to test without before I gave my other phone away). Seems to lean a bit more green. Also noticing a bit more colour shift when viewed off-angle.

Is this normal for OLED?

I have the MagSafe clear case for my 12 mini and Ive noticed that when I attach my MagSafe wallet it doesnt make a sound and show the animation. It makes the sound and vibrates when I take the wallet off, just not putting it back on. I have the leather case and the wallet makes a sound both when putting it on and taking it off. Same with just the naked phone. Anyone else had this issue with the clear MagSafe case? Could it be faulty or is there some way to fix it?

Is this normal or do I need to return it? Thank you in advance!

Sorry about the long rant, there is not many recent threads on people using dual sim iPhone. 

If there are easy solutions to fix some of these problems, please let me know. 

I have a 12 pro with esim for personal number (P) and physical sim for Business (B) set up in phone, primary number is Business and data is set to personal as I have plan with a lot of data. 

Contacts   
I have set 2 groups of contacts for personal and Business, then gone into each contact and set always use on the sim I want to use for each. (takes ages to do this) what I also did is colour code the photo for each contact red or green so that its easier to identify in text messaging which I will get to in a moment. 

Is there a way to bulk colour code contacts? Or is it only one by one?

Phone calls  
    
Works really well for that it is, incoming calls have a little P or B underneath the number. New phone calls ask with line you want to use, if someone calls you and you call them back it will use the same line automatically. Recent calls list has a P or B next to the number or contact name. 

I would give it a 7/10 as there is room for improvement, but works ok.

Txt Messaging

This is 1/10 as best, all of the handy things I mentioned in Phones calls part dont exist for messages. Your inbox is all combined which would be fine if it was easy to identify which sim was being used like how it is in the recent calls section. 

The only way to see which line is being used is, select into message/tap contact name or number at top/tap info/where it will say which line you are using. 

If someone txts your business line for example, I can never change it my personal line for future txts without deleting the whole thread and creating a new txt message. 

Also if you had a lot of threads imported to the phone, IE didnt send from your iPhone 12 then it will automatically send messages from the default line, ignoring what sim to use in contacts. It doesnt give you the option to select a line either, so when I first got my phone I txt a whole lot of people not realising it was sending from my business line.  Now I have to either delete the whole thread, some of my friends threads could be over a years worth of messages just so I can get it back onto my personal line. 

The 1 point is for when you start a new message, here it pops up which the option to select which line you want to use similar to how you make a new phone call.

I hear a lot of people talking about waiting for the iPhone 13 as it will have a higher refresh rate, well after seeing this higher refresh rate in person I dont understand why people make such a big deal out of it. iPhones are very smooth already and there might be a very tiny difference but nothing crazy! 
I understand why other phone brands users might see a massive difference when jumping to 120hz but the iPhones are already so well optimised that everything feels so smooth anyway

Ive noticed that ever since updating to 14.3, my battery has been draining unusually fast. Using the 12 pro max. Unplugged from the charger at 11pm last night before bed. Woke up at 9am and the battery had drained 6% to 94. Ive used the phone for about 20-25mins, just very short YouTube videos and some social media browsing and Im down to 82% already. I was not draining this fast prior to the update. Should I exchange the phone or wait it out?

Im talking about without even lowering it below my nose.  The 12 is frustrating me so much.  I got it one time with a face mask.  Then i had to reset it again and its not working again?  What is the key to get the Face ID to recognize half face?

So Ive recently bought the pro max with the anker 20w and the mag safe wireless charger.   

I used to always keep my phones between 20 and 80ish percent when i had an android and letting it deplete to 0 once a month. 

When buying the iPhone I looked it up again and I read about the battery Ive read that you should keep it between 40 percent and 80. 

I try not to charge over night and unplug before I fall to sleep. Unless I fall to sleep before doing so. This is the only time its really at 100%. 


Do you guys have any tips or could you share your charging habits if you have any! 


Cheers!

first of all,  let me assure you, your iphone is built correct, it will not shatter from a first drop (maybe the glass back would) if you're worried, it's time to get familiar with cases.

while walking today, a student bumped into me and i dropped my black iphone 12 with a black case on it, and to my surprise, the case had a faulty bottom (it was by design since the other sides had a hard inside cover, while the bottom only had silicon), so the phone fell down and got a bit out of the bottom side and hit the floor, creating a small bump that took the black colour off. i kinda regret this case, but i had nothing to do since i couldn't find anything else around.

i'm going to try using a sharpie to fix the colour once i'm home, but man, that sucked.

I have an iPhone 12 Pro Max and it looks great in regular brightness levels but when Im using it at night and set it the lowest brightness levels, the colours look a bit greyish.

The grey hue is very noticeable on Instagram videos and pictures compared to when it looks more vibrant on regular brightness levels. 

Also, pure blacks at this level also dont look pure black. They look like theyre faintly glowing.

I already had to return two brand new iPhone 12 pros between the weeks of dec 7 and dec 16. Both phones were through my service provider as opposed to the apple store. 
The issues on both phones but much worse on the second one was:
1) the key board would randomly switch to numbers and symbols when I was typing, so I would constantly have to backspace and rewrite all my paragraphs
2) my phone calls would drop! Every phone call I made would drop if it was over 1 min! 
3) in night mode my pictures and videos would have green orbs 

Such an unreliable phone and such a disappointment for a brand new phone! 

Wondering if others have had the same issue??
Im debating to wait it out for a few months and then purchase the 12 pro at the apple store in jan OR just give up on the 12 and buy an 11 pro.

Hey!
I just got scared when i saw brothers iPhone 11 Peo and my 12 side by side.
The iPhone 12 screen doesnt look completely black from the bottom on a black background like on software update page with dark mode enabled.
If youre on a completely dark room could you please check yours? All you have to do is low the brightness and then put a finger on navigation bar below and then get the phone screen very close to your eyes.
The 11 pro looks completely black as it should look but my 12 looks greyish and inconsistent type from below. :(
Can someone please check.

Hey iPhone 12 crew- and especially those with the PRO- I wanted to share about an app my team created. Thanks to the mods for permission to post a little shameless promotion- but I do think this is pretty cool. The App even vaulted to number 1 in utilities in the US App Store in a single day!!!

[LiDAR NIGHT VISION](https://apps.apple.com/US/app/id1544262327) is a new app from Sperry Labs (thats us)- available for $1 - made for the iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, and the iPad Pro (4th Generation). It uses both the front and back cameras to allow a user to see their surroundings - even in complete darkness. It uses LiDAR in the back camera, and the infrared sensor in the TrueDepth camera in the front.

HOW DOES IT WORK?

Unlike a regular camera, LiDAR and infrared sensors do not need ambient light. They both generate their own light, which you cannot see. Therefore, both sensors will work in complete darkness. [Here is a video](https://youtu.be/W_m87krmKVY) with an explanation and showing it in action (with bonus spelunking content).

The LiDAR Night Vision app turns the world around you into a depth map, where different colors represent distances from your device.

APPLICATIONS

* See in the dark without turning on your flashlight
* Show off your new phone capabilities (most important, right?!)
* Explore how LiDAR and infrared technology works
* Learn about depth maps and seeing without light

OTHER DEVICES

This app will work on devices that dont have LiDAR. It will use the front TrueDepth camera to provide a depth map of yourself and objects behind you. The rear-facing display will not work without an iPhone 12 Pro or iPad Pro (4th Generation).

NEXT STEPS

We've received some great feedback so far. The product roadmap will include capturing video from the app as the next step. And after that- we have a fun little surprised planned! 

Please feel free to share comments or thoughts. We love to engage and will be happy to answer any questions in the comments.

Like, not too hot, but not too cold, but just... warm.

I'll scroll Reddit, browse through Instagram here and there and text over Discord and the phone is just consistently warm... warmer than a phone should be but not to a point where it's overheating. Nevertheless, it's definitely warmer than what I was getting on my previous phone (Galaxy S10+) for doing such simple tasks.

Was wondering if anybody else has that issue. I'm still on iOS 14.1 so maybe that's an issue?

So I recently bought it and I still got the charger from my other phone which has a USB-c connection, so I can use it with the cable the iphone brought in the box. The thing is that it is a 24W wall adapter, and I see that the one being sold for this phone is 20W, so will a 4W difference be a big deal? Could it possibly damage the phone battery?

Id be interested first off to hear what others are getting on their Standard 12s , Mini etc

As for the 12 PM : 

Took it off charge at 4.45am and used it for -

Bluetooth audio streaming in car 
AirPods connection at gym 
Social media including watching a live stream for over 1hr
And a few photos

Phone was standby for half the day in my pocket but still had over 5.5 hrs SOT . At the end of the day at 11.00pm ( Yes PM 19hrs since last charge) the phone still had just under 40% which More than likely would last a lot longer but i topped it up with the new quick charger apple sells. ( which is amazing FYI it charged 40% in the time I brushed my teeth and got changed ). 

So yes the battery life is a phenomenal beast, Im interested to see what others have been experiencing !!

I had to book an in-store appointment to get my new Iphone 12 repaired by an apple authorized service provider. 

Do you think it would take me 5 working days to get it fixed, or would they repair it quicker than that? 

The phone came with 1 year limited warranty, so hopefully it should be free for me also, right? The whole thing is making me anxious, haha.

Hello guys, I just can't understand if my doubts are legit or if I'm simply just dumb. If i'm in a room with a dim light (not plain dark, but not very bright either), is the the brightness of the screen supposed to be dim as well? I have AB on, and whenever I'm in a room with dim lights, I notice the screen to be far too dim, even if I set the brightness level to let's say 90%, I stil find it to be too dim for my liking. By turning AB off however, the screen gets much more brighter, like a whole new level of bright. Is this suppose to happen, or is my unit defective?

iPhone 12 Black 256 GB, Black Silicone Case by Apple, all iOS and apps updates installed as of December 15th, EU citizen

Following issues have been noticed:

&gt; There is no option to receive notifications on the lock screen without having them wake up the screen itself. So if I want to stop notifications from waking up my screen, I have to turn off the same option that disables the notifications from showing on the lock screen when I wake up the screen. I want the notifications to be visible on my lock screen as soon as I wake the screen up, before I unlock it, but when those notifications arrive they shouldnt wake the screen up themselves. This is the only pressing issue, I can live with the other ones.
 

&gt; When multiple sound notifications come through in a short timespan (couple of seconds), the non-first sounds are way louder. Noticeable in chat apps such as WhatsApp and Viber when a few messages come in quickly one after the other, the following notifications play a sound as if volume was turned up twice as much.

 
&gt; Screen of locked phone can be turned on with a single tap. If I disable Tap to Wake, then double tap also stops working. I want to be able to turn it on with a double tap, but not with a single tap.

 
&gt; iPhone persistently turns down sound volume, whether Im connected to Bluetooth or headphones or neither, even though I turned off the Reduce Loud Sounds option.

 
&gt; I am not able to completely turn off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi from the control centre, instead the options in the control centre only turn them off until tomorrow, after which they turn back on by themselves, for some reason. This is so obnoxious and illogical.
 

&gt; Saving a file opened through a browser, such as a PDF, is basically impossible 90% of the time. The Share/Open As options rarely offer the Save To Files function, whereas trying to share file to email or any other app sends a link instead of the actual file. Infuriating. This was handled way better on Android.

I just upgraded from 6S to 12pro and maybe it's in my head but I feel a tingle in my hand when I hold the 12pro. Thought it could be the size and weight of the phone too and tested it by laying the phone on my hand while my hand was flat on a surface and I still feel it. I hope it's the magsafe and not the 5g I feel. Actually I hope it's just in my head. Any one else experience this? (Also, to be clear, I totally didn't believe that 5g is harmful and always thought magnet therapy was a hoax. I'm not one of those guys.)

So I bought my phone around a week ago and everything was perfect. I updated to iOS 14.2.1 and the screen was showing true OLED black everywhere, even the YouTube app in the black screen tests.

Fast forward to today and I finally see that the OLED screen doesnt turn off when I open a black image or watch that same YouTube video. Watching stuff on Amazon Prime also makes the screen flicker on the sides where the screen is supposed to be black.

Updated to 14.3 and the problem is still here. Did we reach any consensus on what is the problem? My best guess is that it is software, because when the phone was rebooting for the update it displayed true black with only the Apple logo glowing during the first stage of the installation process.

First of all : coming from Android and my last iPhone being the 6 !! There was some major OS to adjust to , although you get the hang of it quickly. Everything is smooth and quick , apps seem to be better on IOS vs Android.. 

Size : coming from an s10 I thought the size would be too much for the Pro Max , Nope still small enough that I can hold it in one hand or both depending on situation, I was also worried about the weight but that hasnt seemed to bother me yet! 

Battery : WOW , my s10 had an avg screen on time of 3.5hrs and the standby drain in my pocket was terrible, I could barely last a 9hr work shift without the phone needing charge. Luckily the Pro Max has been a workhorse with only 40 percent draining on the first day after downloading my apps , 1100 songs , 1 hr of Netflix , 1.5 hrs of TikTok and around 1.2 ish hrs of social media. Ill post an update at the end of today with my 100 percent battery start at 4.45am. 

Cameras / Face ID : amazing as expected !! Face ID is wayyyy quicker than my S10 and works at all light conditions or angles, the cameras are just amazing as well..

AirPods Pro : seamless pairing with my phone , easy to change the settings and omg does the cancellation mode and transparency mode work amazingly! The fit for my ears isnt amazing but I could just need to get used to the different shape.. but overall great !!

Overall Im loving my switch back to apple and if anyone is considering the 12 Pro max , get it !! That is unless you have tiny hands :)

Was the quality like of the apple silicone cases ? I used to use them back when I had the 6s and to be honest they always used to chip bits off from just being in my pocket and then peel or the coating would come away .  Got the 12 at launch and loved the feel of the silicone but just couldnt bring myself to get one after my last experiences . How are they these days ?

After playing around with portrait mode for a bit on the iPhone 12, I just realised that night mode portraits would work completely fine with the selfie camera on the iPhone 12. Because if you take a portrait selfie and its pitch black, itll still take the photo and once it have been processed, youll be able to see the depth effect masking out your figure. 
Shame Apple just decided not to activate this feature on the standard models.

Greetings fellas
As you all know, the iPhone 12 series has this problem with the screen that it shows yellow and green colours when the screen is black
And I have also seen a guy here showing his iPhone 12 has a gap between the display and the frame
My question is, are those issues under apples treatment? Is it safe to buy the iPhone 12 or should I wait a little bit so it would be fixed? (Maybe in future batches)
Or should I even get the iPhone 11 instead?
Would appreciate your opinions.

I came from a 6. I dont have an iPad or a personal apple computer. I have a surface pro as my personal. I typically watch Netflix, listen to podcasts, take occasional pics, and use slack/Gmail/gsheets/etc for occasional work on my phone if Im running errands or not by my work computer. 

I bought the 12, kept it for two weeks and convinced myself it was too big. Got the mini, quickly realized it was way too small (I was squinting and couldnt work with the same efficiency as on the 12). Returned it one day later and rebought the 12.

Super happy with my 12 choice. I realized the size is actually perfect for me to occasionally work from it and watch Netflix without needing to take out my surface pro. Its a beautiful phone and even though its bigger, because I dont have an iPad and prefer not to bust out my surface pro every time I want to watch Netflix or see a website more clearly, its perfect for me. 

The mini is adorable, super fast and a good fit for many, but it didnt seem like much of an upgrade from the 6 for my purposes, aside from the fact that its way faster and has a nicer camera. 

Hope this helps someone else who needs to read this!

When setting up my 12PM it asked to do a direct transfer from my X. I opted for that. 

Almost everything moved over. None of the movies in my VLC moved. When I open files my Acrobat folder says 25 items on my X, 16 on my 12. Numbers 8:7. Theres a VLC folder that shows 90 items on the X, 15 on the 12, but all of the files are 0kb. 

What am I missing to get everything moved over?

Hey everyone. I hope everyone on this sub is enjoying that new iPhone 12! Before I formally join in though, I still have yet to buy the iPhone 12. I decided to buy the 12, 256GB but the only thing I can't decide is what color. I really wanted the red one when I got the XR I currently own because the only color they had at the T-Mobile Store was the Blue. I was a little disappointed but the blue color grew on me. Now that I am upgrading, I really want the Red phone because it looks cool but also part of the proceeds goes toward the RED campaign to help fight COVID-19 \[which is very important right now!\]. But seeing how the Red looks different from years prior, That dark blue looks super cool as well. I still have a hard time deciding between Red and Blue. So I have the poll below and have included the rest of the colors just in case neither red nor blue are good options in your opinion. I wanna know before the upgrade offer for T-Mobile subscribers ends on the Apple Store site; if anyone knows when that ends that would be very helpful. Thanks!

Hello iphone community. I made a return to apple ecosystem, coming from Galaxy S10, now I have iPhone 12. This is my second iPhone, first one was 7 plus. 
I feel like I have to post this. Its a great device but with one annoying thing. That is different keyboard heights with emoji and standard keyboard. Is there any way to eliminate such a difference between heights except running 3rd party keyboard such as gboard?

Hey guys. 

I didnt purchase Apple Care, but I get it free for thirty days. I only have a couple more weeks left on my iPhone 12, but I already dropped it once while waiting for my case from Amazon. 

It doesnt have any cracks or anything. But it had a big scratch in the middle that bothers me. 

Will I be able to get the screen replaced ?

I think I learned about the virtual trackpad on r/iPhoneX and I use it ALL the time. I just got my 12PM yesterday and I learned pretty quick (unless Im missing something) that I can no longer hard pressed anywhere on the keyboard to initiate the cursor moving. Instead, I can only do it on the space bar. To add to that, IIRC, I could also select text using the 3D Touch trackpad and cannot with the haptic version. 

Am I right or am I completely missing the setting to tweak this, because Ive become pretty dependent on that amazing functionality.

I have a few questions regarding the iPhone 12 pro max battery...

1) is it better to let the battery run down?
2) in terms of the Battery Settings - Battery Useage last 10 days, some days Im on 40%, others 65% others 80% ... is that how much Ive used until its charged? Or how much its gone down in 1 day?
3) any tips to prolong battery life? - Does constant low power option harm the battery? Manual brightness or automatic?

I did a bunch of reading about the iPhone 12 yellow screen thing that is going on right now, and I thought lets test it out. 

I turned the Philips Hue lights in my room to really white and the screen turned white (true tone on) then I turned off True Tone and there war no visible change at all (obviously, because the light in the room was white. 

Then I turned the hue lights to what I have them normally (a pleasant daylight) and turned True Tone on again and the screen changed and got more yellow 

Below the line, I dont think the screens are an issue, I think True Tone is maybe a Little to radikal in this Generation and That could be fixe with a software update

Sorry I don't know how to include a picture, but is this normal?

I will try to describe as best as possible: when I hold up my phone in the light a certain way, I see that there are two thin, straight diagonal lines in the upper part of the top left camera. Is this the aperture/something normal, or is it something I should be concerned about? The photo quality itself isn't affected.

If you need a TL;DR ... just skip this post. I'm going into a lot of detail here. My apologies.

I've been an Android user going back to the Galaxy S2 Epic back in 2011. While I enjoyed using IOS on an Ipod Touch prior to that...  I was enamored with the larger screen on the S2 Epic, along with the keyboard. I figure both Iphone and Android had apps, so I went with the better hardware.

I really enjoyed that phone. So I bought the S3. And the S4. And the S5. And the S6. I skipped the S7 and bought an S8. I took a couple month detour over to Oneplus and tried a 6T for a few months, and was underwhelmed with the hardware, so I went back to Samsung and bought an S10+. And thats where I was until this weekend. As you can see from my buying pattern... I upgraded phones often because the technology was changing quickly. Then the tech upgrades slowed down, and I've been fine with an every-other-year upgrade cycle.

During my time with Android, there were certain things that I came to enjoy... especially customization of the phone. Using different launchers... choosing which apps to use as my "default" apps... rooting my phone to get crazy performance improvements... installing different ROMs to get an entirely different phone experience when I felt like it. I'm an IT guy. I loved having all that control over everything.

 But as the phones evolved, I started doing less and less of that. Once I got to the S8, there really wasn't any reason to ROOT anymore (phones were running much more efficiently, and the stock software became very solid). The ROM market dried up. And oh, BTW, if you DID root your phone and tripped KNOX, it would disable NFC payments (which I love).  Honestly, the S8 was my favorite phone, I liked it more than the S10+ that I own now.

There's nothing wrong with the S10+. Its a very good phone, still as good as the day it was released, almost 2 years ago. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants an Android phone. 

But Google, Android, and Samsung TOGETHER have really worn me out on the Android front.

I'm pissed at Android because every year they announce all kinds of new Android Features... but half of them only get released to Google's own Pixel phones. Some of them might get rolled out to other makes / models eventually... but thats hit or miss, and you certainly can't count on it. I can't even tell you all of the features they've announced, that I looked forward to, and I never got. 

I'm pissed at Samsung for two reasons. First, as good as their "version" of Android is (called OneUI)... they refuse to bake in basic functionality like changing icons. Their native support will replace maybe 20-30 apps, leaving a mish-mash looking app drawer. This forces me to use a 3rd party launcher... except that Samsung's implemention of "gesture navigation" screws with 3rd party launchers, and the overall experience is getting worse, not better. 

My second complaint with Samsung? ADS. They are insert ads for all of their own products into every app that they own on my phone. The breaking point for me was when I went to go pay with Samsung Pay, and while I'm holding my phone to the terminal, a full-screen ad comes up for Sofi Money. I had to pull my phone back and read the entire thing to make sure I wasn't agreeing to (or declining) something that I didn't intend to. This is inexcusable. I paid flagship-level money for this phone. I don't do ads when I pay that much for a phone.

Now, I could get around those first two issues if I bought a Google Pixel phone, right? Sure. Except that their release cycle always has them getting released with LAST YEAR's Qualcomm chipset, so the hardware is almost a year old already. Additionally, every Pixel seems to have some kind of inherent hardware issue (build quality, screen issues, etc). I think you'd be crazy to buy one. Oh, and the other problem with Google? They are also now inserting ads were I dont want to see them. In the Google Discover feed (thing, news). I'm reading news... and then there's suddenly a completely unrelated advertisement in the middle of it. Again, I've paid premium pricing for this experience... I dont want to see your ads.

So all this leads me back to Iphone. Apple has finally opened up the customization options a bit (still not as much as I'd like, but its better). The displays are every bit as good as Samsung's now. The build quality is excellent. The cameras are on par with any Android phone. I really can't complain at all.

Some things I like more on Android.. some things I like more on Iphone. I won't bore everyone with the details (if you arent bored already). I will say that one of the main things keeping me away from Iphone is one of the main things that finally sucked me in. I DETEST rewarding Apple for the disaster that they have created with iMessage. My son is on multiple sports teams where the coaches communicate via text... and because they are sending messages to 20-30 parents, those of us on Android are not getting the messages. I can't believe this is operator error... I think that this is because iMessage can handle group chats with a larger number of recipients than SMS can, and iMessage does not adapt properly when there are a mix of recipients. I've hated Apple and their "Blue Bubble Brigade" forever now.... but I can't keep missing out on these texts. So I gave in.

Yesterday I got an Iphone 12 Pro Max. The good news is that phone innovation has dropped significantly, so I doubt I'll see a need to upgrade for a few years. At least I know that the phone will hold its value well, if I do decide to sell. I know that I'll get IOS upgrades for years to come. All of my friends and family are razzing me hard for making the switch to the ecosystem I always swore I wouldn't. But hot damn, I'm getting all those blue bubbles that I need.

I've noticed lately that when I try to upload a 4k HDR video from iMovie to Youtube it uploads, but then when I look on a computer at my profile, and go to my channel content under the video it says "processing will begin shortly". I checked back 1 day later on a 45 second video and no SD or HD video were even showing/playable. Yet, when I directly upload from the Youtube app, I can see it in HD within minutes. It didn't used to have that issue as I uploaded a 4K HDR video last month, and I can view it on youtube in 4k and HDR. Anybody else have this issue?

Hey guys, this is Day 3 analysis for my iPhone 12, Navy Blue, 128 GB.

First Impressions: WOAH! This Camera is dang good and I am seriously impressed with the aesthetic of the phone. It's lightweight, it's sturdy, and has a good grip. I drop my phone a ton, so that was the most important aspect of it for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Camera: Just beautiful. I don't do professional pics or use my camera for outdoor pictures much, so this is just a huge plus for me. I mainly use my phone camera for taking pictures of assignments and stuff, so this is good enough for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Battery: I took the phone off charge last morning at 7.40 and I used it for 8 hours with a lot of music, video playing, and picture taking and it brought my charge down to 50%. I didn't charge it through the night for testing, and in the morning at 8, the battery only dropped to 49%. I have used this phone a lot less today, but on a typical day, I just use it for occasional texting, Reddit, and some movie streaming and at 9 in the night, the battery is down to 27% now. Overall, pretty dope.

Hi everyone, after being in the Samsung ecosystem forever, I made the jump to the iPhone 12 Pro Max. Love it - just something that is making me crazy.

I am a notification nut - I get a ton of work emails/texts/Google Hangouts/Slacks a day. I have everything set up correctly, have reset everything a bunch - even went to the Apple store, and nobody can help.

But sometimes, I will look at my phone after a while and see all of these emails/texts, etc that I have missed. No notification sounds, no vibration - even though it is set up to do so. Do Not Disturb is not on - I don't get it.

The guy at the Apple store told me it could be my Apple Watch (which is also new) is taking the notification noises from my phone? Is that a thing?

I am right before my 30 day window to return and want to keep it, just hoping someone has a solution.

Hi folks,

Been loving my new iPhone 12 after coming over from android phones for the last few years. Before that was ping ponging between iPhones and androids. Anyway. I have been using a Samsung Gear S3 over the past few years and have just paired it with my iPhone. Obviously I am not expecting anything as seamless as its integration with my previous S8 and S9. However, Im unable to see my watchs battery capacity in the iOS battery widget. I wouldnt consider this too odd if I couldnt see my (non apple) buds in the widget. Any thoughts? Just not compatible I assume?

I just got an iphone 12 mini after 4 years of Android and I love it! That being said, I also purchased Apple's silicone case for the 12 mini and am not impressed with the finish considering the price.

I've noticed an uneven "lip" in the middle of the sidewall of the case on the top and right side that isn't present on the bottom and left portion of the case. Since this is my first Apple phone in a few years, I'm not sure if this is the expected quality of finish Apple has for its cases or if this issue with the overmolding isn't normal and I should look to return the case.

Has anyone else had this issue or am I being too critical of the case?

Ill start by saying I purchased my iPhone 12 on the date of release (big no no, I guess). I ended up receiving a unit with a grossly discolored screen that was dark green around the edges in non-black screens. After several unhelpful conversations with apple support and Best Buy-Apple extensions, I decided to roll the dice and just go into a flagship Apple location in my area. Im happy to say the guys at the shop were incredibly understanding and quickly brought out another model and replaced my phone free of charge (and without dinging my apple care replacements). I had read on here a few weeks back that people were getting sent home with no help due to Apples hoping that they could fix this issue with a software update (smh). IMO this is clearly a hardware issue, as my new phone has no signs of this issue...


TLDR: if you have the green screen problem, go into the store and get yourself the functional device you paid for and DESERVE

Can anyone explain MagSafe and MagSafe cases to me? Does a case need to be MagSafe to work with a MagSafe charger?
I have an Apple Watch (series 1 -hoping to upgrade next year maybe) and am hoping to get some AirPods this Christmas is the any charging pad that would work for all three? Or what are my options. 
Also back to mag sage. Whats the deal with the wallet? 
I need good protection now as my three year old likes to snag my phone sometimes and I would trust a slab of glass to any three year old especially my bull in a China shop kid

I will be upgrading from a Pixel 3 to an iPhone 12, after years of android phones. Are there any important things for me to figure out, like tips, or specific things I should do that you guys all do when getting a new iPhone? I have a bunch of stuff I used to always do when getting a new android device and i wonder of there are similar things (settings etc) that you all do.

Thanks :)

Hello everyone! Im very new to having an iPhone and Im used to android. (which has a very strong vibrate) sadly after setting up my alarms and stuff I noticed it was very weak and could barley feel or hear it so I made a custom one and its still pretty weak. Is there a setting Im missing or something or is this normal from iPhones.

Im comparing it to the Galaxy s10+ which was my previous phone

My router  [F@ST3864AC](mailto:F@ST3864AC)and firmware is8.386\_F@ST3864AC 

So my phone 12 is new and I still can't access to my home wifi it just freezes after I enter the password and press joined.  \[Imgur\](https://imgur.com/urj4oad) 

My current iPhone 12 iOS is 14.2.1, I have try many troubleshoot including reset the router, and reset network, even recover my phone to factory settings(out of the box)

The only way I can access wifi with my iphone 12 is if I change my wiFi security type from WPA2-PSK to open. My other iPhone 5/5S/7 and other devices can connect with this security type with no problem but not my iphone 12 it needs to disable the security? WTF!

I have contacted my ISP and apple support and nothing was resolve, done every troubleshoot diagnosed.  I still need to try a different wifi connection. 

Just wondering if anyone has this problem or is this a bug for iphone 12

Starting a few hours ago, my iPhone refuses to connect to my WiFi network, it authenticates the network but then doesn't connect to it. It just stays on 4G. If I turn off 4G, the phone is not connected to the internet (but I am still connected to my WiFi network).

The issue is present with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz. I tried restarting the phone and the router to no avail.

I just updated my phone yesterday morning and it was fine that day. Lasted me ~15 hours, so the whole day. Today I took my phone off the charger around 2 and within an hour I was already around ~90-93%. However, I was using a bunch of apps like spotify, gps, instagram etc. My screen on time is usually like 4-6 hours. Also, when I first got this phone in october it seemed like my SOT was longer (7-9 hours) and my phone was still lasting my through the whole day. I feel that if I had that SOT currently, my phone would not make it through the day. 

I have the regular iphone 12. Also, yesterday I made a post here about my phone having issues with dropping signals randomly (not location dependent) and I know a lot of users are having issues with that. I understand things like this happen but its insane for a nearly $1200 phone that the battery isnt as good and the last and has issues performing basic phone things.

The skin would be just for scratches (phones can get scratches even if in a case), and using it just with the skin is too risky as it could break if it falls .. 
just wanted to know if the iPhone fits in the case even with the dbrand skin (full body, sizes especially)

Hi, I am thinking of returning my iPhone 12 Pro Max and instead getting the base/regular iPhone 12. Why? The main reason is I bought it on credit and, while I know I can pay it off within the 12 months, I am also paying off other credit cards and could do without paying $1500 right now (the regular iPhone 12 would come out to a total of $1000 or less if I get the 64GB version). I like the Pro Max a lot, although it can feel a little weighty sometimes. However, I like the big screen and the great battery (I usually get 9-10 hours of screen-on time... amazing!). So, I don't think LiDAR matters to me that much - I don't usually take low-light photos or selfies, or use AR apps/games, although for taking measurements of objects, which I do at times, it may be useful. Otherwise, I believe I will be okay with 4GB of RAM on the regular iPhone 12, instead of 6GB like on the Pro Max, and the smaller screen size on the regular iPhone 12. I mainly/only really need the abillity to record 4k, 60 fps videos both on the front and rear camera, as I record guitar cover videos using those settings. Both iPhones can do that, so I think I am good. Also, I did think of this but I am not considering the iPhone 12 Pro for mainly two reasons - I am busy at home studying for finals and had best not get out and waste time on less-important pursuits like shopping and such, and the iPhone 12 Pro will be delivered a month later if I buy that online and I can't manage that as I need a phone rightaway, AND I would be better off not having the $150 to $200 more for the Pro. Therefore, if I got the regular iPhone 12, what would I really be missing out on or lacking? While I did mention I would be OK with no LiDAR and 4GB RAM and smaller screen, it's the battery life I am concerned about. I am ready to face less battery life than on the Pro Max, but not TOOOO less of course! From Youtube battery drain tests and phone reviews, it seems the regular iPhone 12 still can get around 7-9 hours of screen-on time. Is that correct? Do you guys have any other thoughts? Any suggestions?

Sorry for my long block of text!

So I ordered a silicone case and MagSafe charger for my pro max from the stores website I work at. 

Received today and set up the MagSafe charger in my bedroom and then went downstairs to open up the case. 

When I first opened the packaging for the case and had a look at it I thought the Apple logo was extremely faint but thought this was due to it being the black case ( was a little annoyed because I like seeing the logo) 

When I put the case on it was a very poor fit for the amount Id paid for it and was confused why my 10 one I just took off fit a lot better. This case seems loose near the charging port and doesnt really fit on the top left corner, when pressing the buttons its really stiff. 

At this point I just thought they had sent me a damaged one and was hoping it would fit round the phone better when its been in my pocket for a while ect. 

So after all this I thought well I better go and try the case with the charger. When I put the phone down onto the charger it started to charge but would then fall off pretty easy. Thought it could be the charger so tired it with the case off and it stuck like glue! Looking at the case there isnt even the magnet on the instead so must obviously be a fake!

iPhone 12 VS 12 Pro Price considerations

So heres the deal...
Where I live to the iPhone 12 (64gb) costs about 1000 (!) USD, and the 12 pro (128gb) costs about 1300 (again, !!!) USD (Its absurd but I got nothing to do about it). 
Ive seen many reviewers say that the 12 pro is more future proof with the extra RAM and whatnot, but theres no way its worth spending 300 dollars more for it, am I right? Im not sure which one I should buy as they both cost a fortune, so im seeking ur help. 
Thanks in advance.

Hi

I just recently got an iPhone 12 Pro Max and noticed it had Lens Flare upon shooting pics at night time, May I ask if this is a common problem on all iPhone 12 line and is it also possible that I just a defect?

Is this a valid reason for apple to give me a replacement? Im just a first time user of the iPhone and was wondering if a new replacement would probably be a good solution. 


Thanks

Hi, I just recently upgraded from an iPhone 6 Plus to an iPhone 12 and I love it! I do have one complaint. When I am browsing the web and I try to open a link in a new tab by long pressing, it always highlights the text and brings up the copy lookup share menu. Usually the copy lookup share will be superimposed over the open in a new tab menu. It happens in safari and chrome. Has anyone else had this issue? Maybe I am doing something wrong with the long pressing. It never happened with my 6. Also, sorry if this question is in the wrong place.

Hey, i had reported to apple about the battery drainage issue of mine which was earliest 20-25% overnight which after resetting all settings dropped to 4-5% overnight. I told them that now its around 5% drain overnight and they said to try restoring your iphone once and if the problem will remain same we will replace the phone! 

What should i do? I think many iPhone 12 users are facing overnight drain. Are you guys facing or not and if i should really replace it?

I have the Apple clear silicon case on my 12 PM and I'm not really liking it. After looking around for awhile I think I've settled on the Pitaka ultra slim 600D aramid fiber skin case. The only thing I'm wondering about is if there's any difference in how strong and secure the Apple wallet will hold to the Pitaka case versus the Apple silicon case. Any chance anyone has experience with both of them and can provide feedback?

Hi
Thinking to pull the trigger on iphone 12 pro.
BuT
Have a question, that maybe some photographer can answer?

The camera in the 12 is quite nice, but , many pics are also showing very unreal colors. The feeling i get is that because of the sensitivity of the camera, it kinda burns bright light colors.
Look here :

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnet.com/google-amp/news/heres-what-apple-iphone-12-pro-cameras-can-do-incredible-night-mode-photos-more/

 In The sunrise picture in this url, all the red glow of the sunrise seems burned.
And in all the daytime photos  the sky has very unreal contrast of blue. I see this everywhere on this subreddit also.
The colors seem burned and not right to me.
Any photographers here? 
I mean, iphone 11 seems to be much more natural, though offcourse less details and not such a killer nightmode. Can it be the improved nightmode is messing up the daytime true natural colors?

Today I played Radio (Apple Music Hits) on the 12 pro max while the device was charging and I noticed that the phone does not auto lock on its own. I removed the charging cable after 5 minutes and it got auto locked. Is it normal behaviour?
I played my own playlists and it gets auto locked on charging. 
So this weird behaviour is only with Radio + Charging combination. And it does not matter if the Music app is open or playing in the background, it never locks.
Does someone have the same issue? or Am i missing some setting to fix this? Thanks in advance.

Hello guys,

I'm having a problem in my iPhone 12. When the brightness drops to minimum setting or I make it minimum, there appears a blue pixel near somewhere the right bottom side. In order for this to happen the background should be black (more noticable in a complete black background not just where that faulty pixel is) and brightness should be zero or below ten percent i guess. It does not happen with any other colors, it doesn't happen with high brightness levels (not sure what is the threshold)  and it's just one pixel. I am thinking of changing my device before 14 days (that is the law in here). I was just wondering if anyone has the same issue? If you do did you fix it? If you did not come across such an issue can you check if you phone has it?

P. S. It is really hard to detect this. I noticed it when i was in the bed checking Instagram in dark mode. So it was completely dark at the time. After that, i used a black photo to make a fully black background to see that pixel more clearly. If you are going to try this, a dark environment with little to no light would help.

I tried installing iOS 14.3 with the beta program to see if it was a software issue but that pixel was there after the update. 

Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

Recently, I had just gotten a new iphone 12 pro max, coming home I immediately went to my computer to try and transfer my data from my old phone (an old 6) to the 12. so i booted up my 6s data on itunes waited it for transfer onto the cloud then proceeded to plug in my 12, and tried transferring data from my 6 to it, this turned out to be a terrible choice as suddenly my brand new 12 entered into what is called, a boot loop? im not sure about the proper term but basically it kept flashing the apple logo, itunes said it needed an update, but then failed and sent an error message about needing to factory restore it, so i did the whole charade of trying to restore and then BAM another error message, when i try too force restart it its just a boot loop btw. anyways, please, please please, you guys are my final hope here, i genuinely need help.

First of all, my apologies for being another of those yellow iphone screen posts. Just got the 12, and I can't help but notice that it is a bit warmer compared to my old Samsung when I have True Tone enabled. I still use the Samsung as my work phone, so this isn't even something I can get used to, as looking between the two phones constantly makes one look off. 

Now, there are times when I think True Tone is actually useful? Like it does not seem that intrusive during daytime, but in dark mode, the text is too tinted and actually seems less readable. I don't know if it's just me, but it feels like it somehow affects the sharpness of the display. Along with that, leaving it off as the opposite effect, and everything is too blue. Annoying for a $900 phone. 

So, what's the best way to deal with this? Before you say return the phone, I got this from a relative traveling in from America, and I don't think taking a flight is reasonable to fix a phone is quite possible. Hell, I don't even have the purchase receipt. 

So, True Tone on and deal with the yellow, off and deal with the blue, or on and mess around with colour filters until it looks like it makes sense? Since the phone does seem to go between two extremes, I assume a software fix is possible. It's not even so invasive that I would say it ruins the phone experience, but I'm kind of obsessive about the minor stuff. I'm just hoping there is a fix i can use myself.

Hey guys, 

I just bought a blue apple silicone case. Wasnt a cool feature of magsafe/the new silicone cases the way the magsafe charging screen changes colors depending on the case? Or did I just imagine I saw that? 

If its real, how do you make that happen?

Thanks!

If yes, that's fine. It could be the way apple intended. But if not, how do I find out if my device is defective?

Also, when I compared it to my 11 pro, it was definitely warmer and more saturated. Is it intentional?

Such an amazing iPhone, beautiful design. But way too many issues for this price and no 'innovative features', if you pay this kinda money you should expect nothing less that a brilliant device with no issues but here it seems that every 1 in 2 iPhones has a display issue of some sort, yellow/green tint, flickering and no true blacks (which I have it on mine too), some complain about a gap between the frame and the screen which eventually could compromise water resistance (had it on a previous iPhone X and saw someone complain about it with the 12 series too). The higher end model costs $1099, but what does it bring in terms of new features? Phones that cost a a third of this have 90/120 Hz screen, things like a under the screen Touch ID and little to no notch. Yeh I am probably still gonna stick to apple, because of its seamless ecosystem and how everything is well integrated but come on ..seriously? Dont get me wrong I absolutely love iPhones, but lack of quality control and no new features in an overpriced device ..are they really acceptable? Mine is just an opinion

Wanted to share my video experience of the trip. Stayed 4 days in Springdale Airbnb. Id say my favorite was The Narrows, Bryce Canyon Hike, Angels Landing in that order.  All were more incredible than I thought. 

Day 1 - The Narrows (didn't rent boots or walking sticks...regretted it. was almost too cold to continue but it warmed up. Made it all the way to wall street. Favorite hike of all.

Day 2 - Angels Landing (sunny, fun, not as dangerous as I thought, but scary)

Day 3 (BRYCE - Queen's Trail to Navajo Loop. Beautiful and sorrel, caught it at very good lighting. The canyon is so picturesque my friends and family thought the pictures were fake. Very fun and easy cooldown hike

Other notes : RIP Porters Smokehouse :( Our Airbnb was across the street from the restaurant and we decided to eat dinner there at 7 pm. I bought hiking shoes at the attached gift shop. Food was good and we went to bed.........We woke up to the smell of burning plastic at 1:30am and porters were fkn ON FIRE!!! In the morning, it was totaled and collapsed :( We were one of the last customers.

I only use 4g on my phone because theres a small amount of 5g in my area and I dont necessarily need 5g. However, sometimes I notice that my LTE signal will drop to one bar and then I have no service(in areas I had no problem getting service with my iphone 6s). Also, my signal doesnt drop at the same location consistently either. Its very random and doesnt seem dependent on the location.

 When I got my phone I just used my SIM card from my 6s which is from 2015/2016. Im on verizon. I suspect maybe I should get a newer SIM card and maybe that would iron out the issues but Im seeing that this is a widespread issue among the 12 lineup. I have the regular 12 and everything is great besides this issue. Has anyone experience similar and/or contacted apple or their carrier? Wondering if anybody has found a solution to this because its quite annoying.

This morning while using my phone at about 0-5 % brightness i noticed a slightly greenish color to the screen which changes to normal as soon as i slide the brightness up at all. I really don't want to be looking for problems and I don't think this is the same issue as other people reported as my blacks are fine, just wanted to know was it normal for perhaps OLED displays as it's my first one. My room was pretty much black and I think that's necessary to see it. Thanks in advance.

On Saturday I went to buy an iPhone 12 and I noticed that my screen is like lot warmer than my previous iPhone 8 Plus, so I dont bother, I thought that this is because of OLED screen. 1 day later I compared to an iPhone 11 Pro and its noticeable, iPhone 11 Pro has a whiter display, I mean like more blueish, less yellow tint and the white looks better. Is this a problem with all iPhone 12 and will it be fixed?

Hi guys, so I got the iPhone 12 on launch day and I literally love everything about it (I upgraded from an iPhone 7+).but I have noticed that my pictures and my videos are blurry, not just In low light conditions but also very well lighted places too. Does anybody else have this?  Or is it just me? What can I do to fix it?

 So [we know now](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/10/29/the-real-story-behind-magsafe-usb-c-pd-and-why-you-need-a-20w-ac-charger) that to get the full 15W charging out of a magsafe connector you need a USB-PD 3.0 charger that specifically has the 9V - 2.2A power profile.

For home AC chargers, the new Apple 20W brick works (of course) as does the [upgraded Anker Nano](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WRKXQ8W).

Has anyone found a car (cigarette lighter) charger that supports this power profile?

So I got my 12 Pro Max upgrade last week and as beautiful as it is, I was overwhelmed by the size of it. Its a little more uncomfortable to hold compared to my XS Max. 
I didnt think this would be a problem since Ive been handling a large phone for the last 2 years and opted for the Max since I got a good deal but I think Im going to return it and order the 12 Pro. 

Id like to give my wrist and hand a rest from handling a big phone everyday, they ache after long periods of use. Id like to be able to use my phone with one hand again. Im just a little worried I might miss the big screen and great battery life lol. Im not too bothered by the cameras, theres not much, if any difference between them from what Ive seen.

Has anyone downsized for similar reasons and had any regrets at all?

Nothing changed between settings when I upgraded from a 6s on ios14 and my 6s synced no problem.

I am very disappointed by the OLED issues with this 12 lineup, you can't be spending that kind of money and not expect absolute perfection... especially if its something like the OLED screen, which is known for its pure blacks. They will refund the device, as they can't replace it (no stock till March).. so now I either wait till March to get another 12 Pro Max or wait till September/October and get the 13 since its rumoured it will have a better camera , Touch ID and 120 Hz, all of which iPhones should already have but oh well.

Should I get 12 PM in March or wait September/October for the 13?

Hey guys! So hear me out when I first saw this website I thought it may be a scam. However I decided to bite the bullet and purchase a couple of their MagSafe-compatible wallets. After waiting for a week or so I got them in the mail. Now let me tell you the quality on these wallets is just as good as apple if not better and the magnets a surprising strong.

So I bought 12 pro max two weeks ago or so, few days ago problems with wifi appeared. So the indicator is full, its not reconnecting or anything but speed is ten times lower than it should be (measured on speedtest.net). Its appearing randomly and I am not sure what makes it go back to normal speed, I did a network settings reset once but wifi still goes really slow sometimes. I also tested this on my other devices and cant really reproduce it. Celular network, mobile data, bluetooth and everything else works just fine. I am worried if the phone is faulty or something, by the way I am on latest iOS 14.2. Anyone had similar issue?

Been using Samsung since the first galaxy and a big fan of android. I was young when the smartphone journey started and was totally into custom roms, mods, customizations and all the perks of android world, now with all those things which were interesting that time doesnt feel the same anymore ,(may be in aging up and god bored) . Last year I tried 11 pro max , though the device is lovely I was stuck with the limitations of iOS compared to android and went back to android. Now this time around knowing all the limitations and the advantages I can get with apple I bought a 12 pro max , AirPods pro and Apple Watch series 6. Switching the eco system completely makes me feel immersive into the apple world, hope I can stay within this economic system going forward .

Any tips to get adapted into would be most welcome

Has anyone else experienced this lately? Ive noticed in the past few days that my phone will unlock with Face ID while Im wearing a mask. It wont work if Im wearing a surgical mask but if I have a neck gaiter pulled over my mouth and nose it will still register my face. Is this because the camera can still detect my nose and figures thats good enough? Or did apple push an update which made Face ID more lenient during the mask mandate? Wondering if anyone else has experienced this. Ill try to make a video of it later and post if I can.

I have always used a case for my phones.  Always. But I like the color and sleekness of my new (blue) pro. Thinking of using it without case so I enjoy its size, slimness, and color.  Stupid idea? 

I put a screen protector on the front.  I think there are protector films you can get for the back?  What about camera lens? 

Should I just use my case or can I go naked, for once.  I have AppleCare.  Thoughts please - Thanks!!!

Woke up the other morning and my battery had drained by 40%, checked the battery stats and exposure notifications were on 67%. My COVID track and trace app has apparently been draining a lot of battery. 

Now Im not advising to turn it off, but if youre experiencing excessive idle drain, it could be due to exposure notifications.

I turned mine off last night to test it - also have Siri disabled - and my battery drained 6% between midnight and 7:30am. Exposure notifications are turned on again now that Im in work.

First of all, I know no phone is perfect and there will always be little quirks and issues with any new phone that will likely drive me crazy. But potentially spending the kind of money to get a 12 Pro Max, these online reports of yellow or green tint issues and connectivity problems when going from a 5G area to LTE area (and vice versa) are really scaring me.

The 11 of course carries the risk of having the touch screen issue that Apple just acknowledged a few days ago. Due to Covid, I really would prefer not doing back and forth exchanges and want to just keep my new device.

Unfortunately, Verizon is ending support for non HD Voice devices like the 5s at the end of 2020, so I have to make my decision pretty soon.

Hello,

I bought an iPhone 12 Mini about a week ago. I have been experience massive heat and battery drain coming from it.

I have some issues in the past with this, since my iPhone 10 and iPhone 11 Pro Max. After less than one year my 11 Pro Maxs battery health was at 83%.

Is there something that I have done wrong with my phone and perhaps my information transferred through iCloud that is messing with the phones?

In the past I have done so many restores and resets, etc. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Ive noticed that pressing the screen down one inch from the center makes a cracking sound. The problem doesnt replicate after.

Me and my SO (hes got a iPhone X) go driving on the weekends and well pass through an area where it temporarily gives us no service for a few minutes. But his X will immediately search for service once we leave the area and go back to full LTE while mine doesnt (we both have Verizon Unlimited plan). Even when we reach a city, my phone will still stay as No Service until I turn off/on my phone.

This will always happen in areas where I get no service. Anybody been experiencing the same issue?

Just got the phone on launch day and already I'm having issues with the lightning port not working on a weird hardware/software level.

So every time I do a hard reset with quickly releasing the volume up and down and holding down the power button, the port will start to work again for charging. If I do a full restore from iTunes, the port will work again for charging and lightning headphones, but eventually the lightning headphones will stop working and the charger will have a 50/50 chance of working.

No debris, I kept it away from water even though it does have decent water resistance rating. Already went through all the motions with Apple support and they said they could not detect any issue with hardware remotely. So I'm sending it in for repair because there are no local appointments available.

I understand sometimes electronic stuff have issues. I'm a tech guy, but I was really disappointed that I'm already having issues with this **otherwise amazing phone**, but I really just wanted to see if anyone else had a similar experience.

Good reviews
Drop protection at about 6ft

Is it too early in the release cycle to be looking for a case? Perhaps I just go with a $10.00 case and hope for the best for now?

I bought my iPhone 12 Pro on its release date and unfortunately already got a small chip on the frame. I purchased AppleCare Plus and am using their express replacement program to get a replacement phone. My understanding is that the replacement phone might not be a brand new iPhone however the Apple representative I spoke to on the phone said since its taking 2+ weeks for my replacement phone to arrive most likely it will be brand new. Anyone has any insight into this? I just feel bad for spending so much money on a brand new iPhone 12 Pro just to end up getting a refurbished replacement phone. Anyway I can find out if my replacement phone will be brand new or refurbished (I read online that you can check the model number)?

i am coming from an iPhone 7, which was broken several months ago, and i decided to get an X but then kept getting up and up in my decisions until i just decided that it's going to be an iPhone 12 or an 11 Pro.

Gotta say, this is one of the best decisions i have ever did. i love the flat edges design (although i have to put a case on it), the battery life destroys any iPhones i've ever had in my life. and fast charging with my old Anker PowerPort II (which has an 18 watt PD port) is so amazing. gets up to 55% in 30 minutes, but takes a little around 2 hours for a complete full charge (i guess the phone might be charging at 15 watt instead of the full 18). i can get a day or two easily with fair usage.

the display was a bit of a worrying part since i live in Morocco, where there are no Apple stores to even replace my phone if it had any of the issues that were mentioned. turns out the OLED screen is just flawless, and such an upgrade from my other iPhone.

i guess i don't feel concerned by some of the other technologies inside the phone, like the magsafe and the 5G and i would have easily traded those for the price to come cheaper. while mentioning 5G, the phone only has 3 modes in the settings 2G, 3G and 4G, and i guess maybe it will activate once my mobile operator starts building their 5G network, but the LTE speeds are enough for me.

finally, the cameras were such a huge deciding factor: as i said, the 11 Pro was also considered, but i just didn't feel the 3 camera setup, especially since the portraits could still be shot on the 12. the 2-lens just looked more aesthetically pleasing i guess. the photos on the other hand were so good, the night mode and everything, flawless.

the only thing i may regret about not getting the 11 Pro was the size of the phone. i tried holding the X and it was a nice touch. the 11 Pro is similarly sized, the 12 looks kinda alright compared to my dad's 6 Plus, but even with my long hand, it's still hard to hold the phone (case is on) and type, but i'm getting used to it. (i'm also saying to my self that even a smaller notch phone would have been hard to reach the top screen with, so whatever).

one last thing i just realised and was the reason why i wrote this, was the EU label on the phone (since mine was brought from Spain), i have the black colour, so believe me i never even realised those were a thing until i remembered some article that said they looked ugly, removed the phone case and guess what, you can barely see them. you have to had the right light and phone rotation for them to appear and it's just great.

I have the iPhone 12 mini. Ive noticed that when charging the phone, whether it be wireless, 5W or otherwise, the screen will max out at maybe 50% brightness. I can turn it up all the way but it wont get any brighter. I notice this mostly when Im using phone for navigation and charging at the same time. It also happens when Im just sitting inside on WiFi and charging while using the phone. 

Has anyone else? Im assuming its because of overheating but could it also be exclusive to the mini because of its size? Everything is cramped together so maybe its more susceptible?

Its kind of frustrating to me because I use my phone for navigation a lot and I have to keep it plugged in because the battery isnt really strong enough to leave it unplugged. However, it makes it really difficult to see the screen on a sunny day when it wont get any brighter. 

Before you ask, its not defective. This is my second mini and it has happened on both. The first was returned for other reasons.

Hey there guys. So basically my 12 pros screen has been looking dim since day one. Like truly disappointing. I thought I got defective unit and I was gonna call Apple today to ask for a replacement. Just a few minutes ago I was checking up the settings and disabled the AB option. After about 5 seconds the screen became super, like super duper bright. Incredibly bright, like way brighter than the maximum brightness with AB on. Now, is my AB sensor defective? I just turned the AB back on and its back to dim. Should I ask Apple for a replacement or just live with the AB off?
Im kinda confused.

Hey guys, my friend has just switched to an iPhone 12 pro max. For the first week it all worked fine however she is now having an issue with calls. When someone calls her she cant hear the caller once she answers but it is fine if she makes an outgoing call. Software is up to date and I cant find anything online about the issue. Any ideas?

Hello, I was looking into the elevationlab cord dock ([https://www.elevationlab.com/products/corddock](https://www.elevationlab.com/products/corddock)) to pair with the iPhone 12.  


The product seems to get with a Apple MFi certified lightning to USB-A cable. I was wondering in terms of charging the phone would this cause much of a charge different? And would this then be slower compared to a 7.5w wireless charge / MagSafe?  


If so what would you recommend in terms of a stand set up?  


Thank you for your time.

Is it worth getting a 360 case for the 12 Pro Max? Are those cases gonna damage the screen rather than protect it? Will the screen loose quality and touch? Will the phone get much more wider in size? Looking for advice on whether there are good 360 cases out there or if its useless getting one.

Has anyone thought about going back to Android but can't leave iMessage? I was was an heavy Android user till about the iPhone 8. Since the 8. I've had every iPhone since. As much as I want to try out all the new Android phones I just can't see myself leaving iMessage for obvious reasons. 

There's other reasons also, like the fluidity of iOS, well polished apps, photo and video quality, airdrop, etc. Just seeing if iMessage was anyone's reason of many to stick to an iPhone.

So I finally found a genuine MagSafe wallet. I got a couple knockoffs that I refused to use because of the weak magnets. The real one is great. The hold is great when paired with my genuine apple silicone case. It easily holds 3 cards. Recommend. 

I am now transitioning a couple of my cards to being in the wallet app instead of carrying them. My only issue now is trying to figure out the best way to handle cash. I am trying not to carry much however I always have and need some.

For some reason I'm not receiving any notifications for both of my email accounts in the native mail app? I've got badges and lock screen notifs turned on for both accounts but I'm still not receiving any notifications at all. When I actually go into the mail app, it downloads all the missed emails at the same time. Does this have something to do with the push/fetch feature and is there a way I can fix this? Thanks in advance.

So I will start by saying that I think the 12 Pro has a better screen that my 11 Pro Max....but...

The other night I was sitting with both and looking at my wallpaper and I noticed the colors were a bit different, same wallpaper on both. So I started playing with the settings and got everything set the same. Turned True Tone on and off, played with brightness and all that jazz.

I noticed that the 12 Pro was at all times a bit warmer that the 11 PM. I have seen others talk about this but is it really an issue or is it something that might be intentional?

I wish I had pictures to post with this...if the discussion rolls on Ill get em later today after work.

Hey guys! Currently writing this from my iPhone XR &amp; happy to announce I am receiving my iPhone 12 tomorrow!

I have a few questions. I want to keep my 12 for the longest time possible.

How should I charge it?

People have stated that you shouldnt let it drain when you first get it. So when I first get it, when should I plug it in?

After this, how should I charge it?

I want to stray away from overnight charging, and have read that charging it when its around 20% is optimal. 

What do you guys think?

I have seen that the iPhone 12 Series is facing thermal throttling issue on prolonged gaming. Is it so? 
I have returned my OnePlus 8 Pro for iPhone 12 and it seems like iPhone 12 gaming is poor than the OnePlus 8 Pro according to Youtube Videos.

The game geshkin impact runs just well on the OnePlus 8 Pro but on the iPhone 12 it lags alot.

I have paid 360$ extra for the 12.
Im concerned just because im gonna use the device for very long!

What are your reviews on the iPhone 12 gaming?

This is not a swipe at those who wish to protect their investment. I'm right there with you trying to get the best of both worlds: the sleek design of the iPhone 12 pro but also mitigate shatter risk. 

I got the Apple leather case. It's ok, but not $60 worth it. I'll be returning it. Here are my qualms against a case:  


1. Adds bulk
2. Degrades the handheld experience
3. Is not an absolute guarantee to elminating risk  


When I start to think through it, my confusion is what compels me to cover up a beautiful phone other than just habit? I could have gotten the iPHone 12, or Mini instead and saved a couple hundred dollars, but I got the Pro because of its design..

So i started digging around. I thought about a pop-socket, and although functional, it's really ugly. This is the closest idea to something I might go for [https://youtu.be/ZdYxz3Xrt0A](https://emails.kickstarter.com/ss/c/5Ixklp3QcabAdTzhlCDOguvctLia8880pikb9TZMREY6OLuYalQKI2LShZN3rd_c/37e/hO_JY0APRqKMed5xcGn45w/h4/B0Id8N9sRsRgRr6aBJKNUq_Nljwc7OxNfbbW2MjKl18) but it's like 4-6 months out. The idea of the finger loop really impressed me though. What if there's a MagSafe accessory that's just a finger loop. While you'll sacrifice protection of the case it can at least:  


1. Improve grip
2. Elevate the phone slightly off the ground to prevent scratching when placed on hard surfaces
3. Maintain slim profile
4. Perhaps also double as a kickstand

What are your thoughts on getting a case, and have you see any options like this?

I have a tech21 case right now for my XS Max - I like the comfortable feel of it, it has a grippy, bendy and soft feel but doesn't feel cheap so I would like a similar one for my new 12 Pro Max. Finding the right one has been tricky, considering the 12 PM has flat edges, so anything that would make holding it comfortable would be even better. If it helps any, I don't like Otterbox's style. It's too slippery and too hard for me. 

I was looking at Apple's Pro Max Silicone case online, but I don't know if they're any good.

Hey all. Has anyone else experienced frequent freezing or latency when on cellular? Ill be scrolling through Twitter, browsing websites, or talking in Discord and all the sudden nothing will load or respond anymore. It takes me closing and opening the app again for data to move once again. This seems to happen every 15 minutes and is extremely annoying! Not a problem at all on WiFi. 

It Happens over 5 and 4G. Ive forced each individual connection to test both, hoping it was just a 5G issue, but its not. This also never happened with the Pixel 4 XL I was using before this iPhone in the exact same places; work and home. Network speed isnt the issue either because I get 300 down in my office over 5G (T-Mobile). Also running the current iOS 14.2.1, but this has been an issue ever since I got the phone with vanilla iOS 14. Trying to figure out is this an iPhone 12 problem or T-Mobile problem.

This is the first Apple case I have ever bought, I bought a black silicone case for the iPhone 12. Apple case. Ive been really happy with the case but the past few days, Ive noticed the phone slips somewhat out of the case while it is in my pocket. Im not sure why, it seems to fit snug around the phone when I have it in my hand. This is happening to anyone else?

Anyone know how to clean the leather case in a way thats safe for the case and would also be effective at removing coronavirus? Or can that not really be easily done every day? I know the traditional ways to clean leather; they just dont seem like theyd be particularly effective against Covid and they also seem time intensive, as opposed to cases made from other materials which I can just quickly wipe down with a cleaning wipe or spray. (I also know they say surfaces arent a big deal anymore in terms of transmission, but still looking into my options.) Ive done Google searches but havent come across anything particularly helpful.

Hello, I have a quick question. My gf has an iphone 7 plus. I want to get her the iphone 12 for Christmas. She is on T-Mobile but I will purchase through apple directly as it's a little cheaper. 

When she opens it on Christmas, can she just swap her sim card over?  Are they the same size?

I've seen she can copy all her data using icloud so that shouldn't be an issue.  I just want her to use it on Christmas day without having to do anything through TMobile or needing to go to one of their stores.

Just got an iPhone 12, and it's my first time switching over from Android.  
I was looking at cases and most don't have any real protection for the camera lens... If I were to scratch that (I'm pretty clumsy), would AppleCare+ cover it? Is there anything at all AppleCare+ won't cover?  
Also, I heard recently that AppleCare+ only covers 2 incidents in 2 years, but I then I read it's 2 incidents in 1 year. Can anyone clarify?

Hiya! Hope you guys are loving your iphone 12 as much as I am :) I noticed recently some dust and debris in the space between the screen and the aluminum frame. Its almost like a gap so i can put the corner of a piece of paper in it. Is this a problem? Should I return my phone? Its brand new (4 days old), so it's not from a drop or anything?

Anyone who has a 12 and charges with the MagSafe charger are you experiencing any weird loud and soft volumes? I erased my device today cause of the issue and the problem only came back right after I started charging with the MagSafe. Most predominant is when I lock the device with the lock sound on. it sounds like a huge clack, rather than the normal soft lock sound. my typing and notification sounds are also loud and soft at times.

I use the 12 pro max and I can say my battery could easily last a full day away from the charge, hell I would imagine it could do a day and a half, Im currently running a experiment to see if it could be my only/ main device.
So far I am Very surprised. 
The camera and battery to me are the biggest selling points and the screen quality for streaming Netflix.
Anyone else doing something similar or using there iPhone as there main device/ computer?
Thanks,

Hi everyone, 

I have a quick question. What settings do you have on your iPhone camera for such amazing photographs? Thanks so much.
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-12-01
Hi, everyone! 

I just got my iPhone 12 (regular) in the mail, and my GOD I understand the hype. Seriously, this thing is a little beast and I cant remember the last time I enjoyed an Apple product so much. Wow.

I was wondering if any of you had any insight as to why my cameras behaving the way it is. I dont think its faulty, as the photos Ive gotten so far come out pretty decent and crisp but only AFTER the photos are taken. In the immediate camera view, regardless of whether its a selfie or a back camera photo, the photos always look a tad fuzzy / out of focus (even pressing on the screen to focus to no avail). But, the second I hit the shutter, the little gallery icon in the bottom left corner spins for a second and my picture looks crisp and incredibly detailed.

What gives? Do I have some sort of adjustment or post-processing setting enabled that Im not aware of? Im coming from two years on Android, so Im not quite up to speed on recent iOS features (and Ive only had this phone for about 48 hours). 

Any feedback would be appreciated! Im sure its probably just something dumb that Im missing in the settings this phone is working wonderfully, so Im really hoping its not actually faulty. I dont want to send it back! 

Thanks!

I upgraded to a 12 pro max from an xs max. I love big phones and Im used to handling them. Full disclosure Im a pretty big guy at 6 4 with above average sized hands. 

The 12 pro max is unlike any phone Ive ever used. Its closer to walking around with an iPad. Its big and heavy but after using it, theres not going back. The battery life is unreal, the screen is beautiful, and the whole thing just feels premium. Compared to the 12 pro max, my xs max just feels like a toy. 

The weird thing is, I just cant keep hands off of it. The thing is just completely engrossing. Im sure once the newness wears off it will die down, but right now I cant stop marveling at the screen, the speed, the camera and the build. 

Its certainly not for everybody, but if big powerful phones are your thing you will be in heaven.
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-12-01
*\*Note: I've had the phone for a week and upgraded from an iPhone 7. Although the difference is big, I had the opportunity to regularly use my girlfriend's iPhone X and still never felt the need to upgrade until now. Also, I titled this "A realistic perspective" because I watched a lot of 'first impression' videos on Youtube and heard some criticism that I think was more "clickbaity" than helpful.*

# I've never been one to buy expensive phones. It's never been because of a lack of funds; I just never could justify spending $1,000+ on a phone.

I consider myself a frugal person, using the following definition from FundingCloudNine.com: ***A frugal person is someone who cares about the cost AND quality of an item, while also valuing their time. Frugal people practice conscious spending.***

I'm always considering the cost as well as the quality of an item when making purchasing decisions. 

That's why it's been tough to shell out the extra money for an expensive iPhone.

For the most part, they all practically do the same thing.

They have great cameras, a smooth user experience, and they keep you integrated with your other Apple products.

One could argue that an iPhone 7 is just as good as an iPhone 12 in terms of its core capabilities. 

And I use to be the one making that argument...until I upgraded my phone from an iPhone 7 to an iPhone 12 Pro Max.

# iPhone 12 Pro Max Battery life

The first thing that struck me was how long this phone lasts. 

I charge it once at night, and the next day I use it for practically everything: Slack, Netflix, Instagram, Reddit, Wrike (project management tool), Gmail, Youtube, web browsing, and client calls.

After a full day of use, I end the day with around 25-30% battery life.

This is a huge plus for professionals because if you're like me, you're using your phone for work, and there's nothing worse than missing a client/work call because your phones dead.

I had gotten so used to the terrible battery life of my iPhone 7 that I didn't realize how frustrating it was to have to charge it multiple times a day.

# iPhone 12 Pro Max Screen Size

Obviously going from a 4.7 screen size to a 6.7 screen size is a huge jump.

That being said, it has been amazing to have the extra screen real estate for texting, reading emails, and even working on projects.

While waiting in line yesterday at a USPS location during my lunch break, I caught myself actually prepping for a client call I had later that afternoon. 

I pulled up my project management app, had the Notes app open, and I was completely absorbed in outlining everything I needed for that call.

Typically I wouldn't do this on my iPhone 7 because...well... I always felt like my small phone was strictly for instant messaging, social media, and emails.

I'm sure I could've done the exact same thing on my iPhone 7 but it was just an overall smoother experience with the iPhone 12 Pro Max's bigger screen.

By the time I got to my laptop (Macbook), I finished the outline with the remaining data points I needed for my call. 

\#Productive

# iPhone 12 Pro Max Camera

I haven't had too much time to play around with it, but from the few photos I've taken, I'm seriously impressed. 

Pictures in low light settings come out looking as if there's a mysterious, bright lamp nearby.

On top of that, the 0.5x lens allows you to capture more on the screen which makes for some pretty cool photos/videos. 

Now you may be thinking: "I don't really need the best camera."

And normally I'd agree with you until I took a moment to think about how happy I am that I had my iPhone 7's camera when I was attending conferences, events, and traveling.

All I can think now is how much better those photos would look if I had had this camera with me at the time.

I also got a great photo on Thanksgiving with my mother in a dim setting.

This alone makes the phone worth it.

\#CapturingMemories

# Is the iPhone 12 Pro Max Too big?

I've read critics talk about how the iPhone 12 Pro Max is a bit too big to use with one hand.

This is true.

Although the iPhone 12 Pro Max can be used with one hand, it feels much better with two.

If something is at the top of the screen, unless you have unusually long fingers, you're going to have to use the ***Reachability*** feature to bring the screen down.

Another thing to note is it's also a little harder to put in and take out of my pocket.

However, it doesn't stick out of my pocket like I've heard some critics say.

This may be because I'm a guy who wears looser fitting shorts/jeans, so take this into consideration if you're someone who wears skinny jeans.

Finally, the iPhone 12 Pro Max is also a little heavier than I expected, but I've already gotten used to its weight.

# Verdict: 9.8/10

With all the benefits I've seen thus far, this phone feels like a mini iPad that can be used for both work and play.

Within the past week that I've used this phone, I'm already using it for more work-related tasks, and I am doing things with it that I normally wouldn't. 

I've also caught myself watching more shows on it than my television.

I gave the phone a 9.8 because I do wish it was a little lighter and a bit cheaper, (I can only wish ).

Other than those two things, the phone has been an absolute dream to use and I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a serious upgrade.

I didn't feel my iPhone X looked obsolete when the XS and 11 were released but this year it's an entirely new design so I upgraded to the 12 Pro Max. I used to think the 5S was the most beautiful iPhone but now it's the 12 Pro / Pro Max.

Nomad Rugged Case

Just a quick PSA:

I recently purchased a Nomad Rugged Case for the iPhone 12 and after a delay in delivery due to being sold out, I finally got it on my phone. 

I found that Theres a small gap near the power button and at the bottom of the screen where you can see the frame of the phone. 

I contacted Nomad notifying them of the defect and they said they were aware of it and that all their cases have this. Their engineers are working to have this fixed and so they are going to give a 50% off discount for the new case in early 2021 to those that purchased this version of the case. 

This seemed a little unfair to me, so I figured Id post it here. Its $50 for the case, and if you wanted to replace it at 50% off the corrected case, youd be down $75 plus about $15 on shipping for a case. 

Nomad looks like they have great products, but if youre looking at this case, I would suggest you wait until early next year.

Hi everybody! I'm going to upgrade to the new iPhone 12, but I'm a bit concerned about this yellowish tint many users are reporting.. since I usually keep my iPhone for many years, I don't wanna buy e get stuck with something defective.

I know, I know. 16gb for 6 years? lol well, now that Im planning to upgrade I couldnt decide if I would get the 64gb or the 128gb cause Im so used to having small storage. Im excited to take videos, awesome photos on my future iphone12 and probably make youtube videos out of it. What storage will be practical for long term use? And how long do you think Iphone12 will last before it gets obsolete?

Besides the extra camera and the difference in the build and materials of the phone, what other true differences are there that set these phones apart? As far as the camera goes, I do most of my photography on a Mirrorless dedicated camera, and only use the iPhone for video and quick snaps. With that in mind, would it be worth it to just save a few dollars and get the 12?

So Im making the switch from iPhone 6 to the regular 12.

When I bought my 6, I recall Telus advising me to remove the phone from the box and use it until I fully drain the battery to 0% for optimum battery function. 
I am wondering if this is necessary when I receive my iPhone 12? Some people have told me yes, and others have said no.
Im confused because Ive also read that allowing the battery to drop below 20% is not ideal for battery health.

(Excuse me if this is a stupid question, as Im not particularly knowledgeable on phones and how lithium-ion batteries work. However optimum battery function is extremely important to me)

My second question is this: 
Is it better to charge my phone with a low voltage block? I ordered a 20W usb c charger but Im reading that fast charge can be damaging if used every time. I should also note that I purchased this block on Amazon, and it is not an Apple product; apparently using non apple chargers can be damaging to the battery, so Im regretting that purchase. 

Thanks!

Hey fam, I found someone close to me that has two iphone 12s and hes selling them for $450 each. im only interested in one but Im not exactly sure what to ask. I know i wont be using verizon as my service, possible visible if the locked phone works on their network. i dont want to assume but ive heard verizon locked phones work on visible. 

what sort of questions should i ask this fella? I know the 60 day unlock rule, does that apply to when he bought it?

Hi everyone, I have a question about the iPhone 12 Pro. Im based in the UK and have a friend in the US that Ill be seeing over the Christmas holidays.

Im thinking having them buy me a 12 Pro (unlocked) for use in the UK as it works out so much cheaper.

Question is, am I setting myself up for trouble? Will a US iPhone 12 Pro work in UK? Is it Americanised? Or can be set up with British settings, keyboard etc. Are there any warranty concerns? Anything else I need to consider? Appreciate this may be a novice question, but really appreciate the help

[picture of the phone.](https://ibb.co/FDV4BtC)

After you read, feel free to post your comments and opinions! This is an open discussion, everyone is welcome.

Notable Details:

&gt; Longtime iPhone user (Since iPhone 4) 

&gt; I have owned and used iPhone X for about 2.5 years now

&gt; I use many other apple products such as AirPods, MacBook Pro, iPad, etc 

So I open the box, set up the phone and begin using it for my first day. The new aesthetic design is nice but Ill come back to that after. The iPhone 12 Pro is great, dont get me wrong however here is where my issues start.. After a few hours of messing around and playing with the exact same layout, wallpaper &amp; app arrangement that I transferred over from my iPhone X, I literally forgot I had the brand new phone in my hands. 

Visually I cannot perceive any difference in the screen at full brightness. (I have 20/20 vision)
As for the difference in Speed, while it is somewhat noticeable holding the phones side by side and opening the same app at the same time, it is basically impossible to notice when Im just using the iPhone 12 Pro on its own.
The cameras are the only noticeable true upgrade I see between these two phones.
MagSafe is cool but it doesnt hold my phone on my magnetic car mount, after about 2 minutes it slips off because the phone is heavier than the strength of the magnets.
Lidar is exciting, like really exciting, but this post is about the average everyday user and most people will never have a use for this feature in the lifetime of owning this phone.

I understand the internals, processing power and even more elements that we dont see on the surface of the phone are improved upon every year and you could always argue the newest iPhone is the best iPhone ever made but at what point are we seeing diminishing returns for the average user? 

In the transition from iPhone 8 to X we saw a major overhaul and upgrades across the board that you felt the second you put that phone in your hands, with the Face ID, no home button and the never ending list of new features that were never possible before on any iPhone. 

And from the X to the XS we (as an average everyday user) see almost no change besides an upgraded camera.

From the XS to 11, practically the same, even better Camera. 

And from the 11 to 12 we see a body design difference and MagSafe is introduced. Still the same giant notch at the top of the screen, a new addition with the Lidar sensors on the pro models but still the same old iPhone features that weve known for 4 generations now.

The iPhone 12 Pro is practically the exact same size fit in my hand (and side by side) as my iPhone X and while using it as my main phone for all things smartphone related, it just doesnt feel like upgrading your iPhone 4 generations should feel like. In my opinion.

This feels more like an iPhone X SSS Pro with a Squared body design than it feels like what we imagined iPhone 12 Pro would be 4 years ago. Or maybe THIS should be the iPhone 11 because for the last 3 generations before, they are all basically the same, when you consider them all running the latest iOS. 

Im not going back an brining up all the Apple announcements over the years to find all the small changes theyve made, Im talking 100% based on the average user with the phone in their hands, whats the difference and how much better &amp; innovative are these phone really? 1%? 3%? 5%? 

I feel like we see a bigger improvement in iOS updates than we do in the actual phones themselves, and iOS still has a LONG way to go before people are really happy with their OS experience and personalizing their devices.

With all this being said, I enjoy the phone, its new, its fast, the camera rocks, it looks cool (without a case) and MagSafe will be fun to use, even though the phone is literally too heavy to stay mounted on my magnetic car mount. I had to buy a new magnet to stick on the case so it wont fall off the mount while driving.. Dont you just love ruining new phone cases to stick magnets on them when theres already a friggin magnet system inside the phone.... 

*Im Disappointed to say the least but heres to the future and hoping we will see a big change again soon.. with 120hz please*

Will we be getting smart battery cases for the new iPhone 12 line-up?
Do you have any news, updates or estimated release dates?

I am upgrading from the iPhone 7 with smart battery case to either the iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 Pro Max. Due to the many hours that I spend kn my phone I need a large battery, but I am worried that the battery of the iPhone 12 (with or without battery case) is too small for me and the size of the iPhone 12 Pro Max is too big for me.

I went to the apple store today but due to Covid you arent able to enter the store for product watching/testing. I might try a different store anytime soon to check if I can handle such a big phone.

Also Im considering wether I should purchase a regular case for the time being to bridge the time until the smart battery case releases.

Any news/updates/tips/opinions; let me know!

So I just upgraded to a 12 pro from an s9 and I'm tryna see if my iPhone has the yellow tint that a lot of people are talking about. However, since I've had no other iPhones, my s9 is the only phone that I can compare my 12 pro to. With true tone and blue light filter off on both phones, my s9's display is a lot colder and seems to have a more accurate white. However, since this is my first iPhone, I'm not sure if this is just the normal difference between Samsung phones and iPhones. Can anyone who's previously had an s9 comment on the difference they've seen after upgrading to an OLED iPhone? Should a non-defective iPhone Oled screen have a similar cold look to a galaxy screen? Or is this just the standard difference between the two brands?
Thanks in advance.

It's quite confusing with the availability of iCloud and things. I don't think i'd ever need 128gb but I plan on using the phone for 3-4 years and it is only an extra 50 euro on top of what I would already be paying. I think 64 would be more than enough though.

Hi, might be a dumb question.

I went into an apple store to compare my Mini to a few iPhones on display at the store. While I had a mixed experience regarding yellow screens in the store. Some phones were yellow like mine. Some weren't. 

But I noticed another issue

When my iPhone is on the lowest brightness it is darker than the lowest brightness of the phones on display at the store.

Settings used -
True tone - off
Auto brightness - off
Reduce white point disabled.

I find it a bit strange. Appreciate the advice

Question

I just got an iPhone 12. My first iPhone since the 3g. But my two kids (now 16 and 18) have had iPhones since the 4.

When we got the iPhone 12 for me and my wife (and the mini for the kids) the guy sold us 4 wall warts because of the lightning to USB-C cables that came with the phone @ 20 a piece.

Not having an iPhone for so long I didnt know better, but tomorrow I am thinking of returning all 4 charger bases.

My kids pointed out thei existing lightning to USB cables/plugs would work fine.




My question is, is there a purpose to these new plug bases other than Apple just trying to sell new stuff? Or is the old cable (lightning to USB) that we have several of just as good as the lightning to USB-c and new USB-c wall plug that we (got scammed into) bought?

The cameras of the iPhone 12 are amazing. But there's one toggle in the Camera settings that caught my interest: Scene Detection. It says something about AI improving the image according to the scene, but I'm curious why Apple decided to allow users to turn it off. So I did a few comparisons with Scene Detection ON vs OFF. Just wanna share my personal observations.

Normal landscape shots seems to be slightly improved by Scene Detection, usually by the colors and dynamic range. Here's a sample:

* [https://imgur.com/Xf1DilB](https://imgur.com/Xf1DilB) and [https://imgur.com/VI3Kqb3](https://imgur.com/VI3Kqb3): HDR seems to be working a bit better with Scene Detection ON, i.e., brighter shadows and all. With ON, I also noticed the sky color is a bit more "natural" if that makes sense. But either way, there's no big difference.

The most drastic change I noticed was with food and human subjects. Scene Detection, when it does detect the food and human subject properly, seems to bump up the saturation and such to emphasize the subject. I only did a couple food examples to illustrate this:

* [https://imgur.com/SZn6RVk](https://imgur.com/SZn6RVk): the true color of the pastry is with Scene Detection OFF. The pastry looks normal in the viewfinder, but after taking the shot, Scene Detection makes the pastry look too bright and saturated for my liking.
* [https://imgur.com/JkGslBG](https://imgur.com/JkGslBG): similar case here, wherein the chicken was too saturated than real life with Scene Detection ON, making it look like the ones produced by Samsung (which I personally dislike).

I don't have samples with human subjects, but the bumping up of saturation happens similarly as with the food samples above. What's annoying is that it's inconsistent, at least with my experience. That is, sometimes the brightening algorithm kicks in, sometimes it doesn't.

TL;DR, Scene Detections seems to do its with high dynamic scenes, but seemingly exaggerates colors of food and human subjects. Do you guys notice the same? And do you keep Scene Detection ON or OFF?

Hello, I know I want a 128GB iPhone 12, in the blue colour, with saddle brown leather case. But I can't decide between the regular version and the mini (I can't justify the cost of either of the Pro models). This is the first expensive phone I've ever considered buying and since I plan to have it for perhaps 3-4 years I want to get this right, so am looking for advice. 

I'm coming from 1st gen SE so I am used to small phones, but have been thinking for the money maybe I should indulge in a bigger screen. That said I wonder if maybe I'll find the bigger screen too cumbersome to handle and not worth the extra money. Conversely over time I wonder if battery degradation will affect the mini more, and my aging eyes might wish I'd gone for a bigger screen.

I don't watch netflix or play games on my phones, at most a bit of youtube. But I plan to take lots of photos and videos and use instagram frequently. Any thoughts that might make this decision easier?

I recently purchased this knockoff magsafe wallet advertised on this sub: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/iPhone12/comments/jr7gvq/i_developed_a_stronger_magsafe_magnet_wallet/). 

https://preview.redd.it/05ufkdj8s2261.jpg?width=888&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfc1e5012b5e574947a4091b3fdfede435252383

I just received both Apple's and this knockoff version and there is a clear difference between the 2. Although this one is much cheaper at around $15-20, it feels a lot worse than Apple's and the magnets are very clearly much weaker as well. I'm assuming all the knockoff ones sold on Etsy and other sites are basically the same with very weak magnets. The knockoff version also cannot realistically accommodate 3 or more cards as putting 3 inside will stretch the wallet and also make it insanely difficult to remove the cards. I realized many others and myself wanted an alternative with stronger magnets so I hope this saves your money!

If anyone is looking for a clear case, I recommend Mous Clarity. Ive tried pretty much every clear case on the market and this is the best so far. The edges are black which I was worried about, but it looks SO clear on the back and you can really see the color the way its supposed to look. It doesnt smudge easily and I never see my fingerprints on it. I have a 12 pro max btw.

It might sound like a strange dilemma to be in.. being indecisive between the largest and the smallest iphone models...

but I think for those of us using the mid-sized ones (such as the iphone X).. you are often left thinking..

should I size up slightly more to get the bigger screen and longer battery life?

or size down a bit, to have a phone thats easier to hold, lighter, etc.

so for those of you stuck in that situation, which way did you end up going?

Hey everyone,

I've checked a lot of reviews and still hesitating between both. I come from a Samsung s8 (5.8in screen) and I just tried both phones and LOVE the new design of this year's.

Now when it comes to the size, i'm a bit torn... The mini seems really ideal in size, but i'm afraid of losing in screen size. i'm not playing a lot on my phone but i watch some videos. The 12 seems just a bit too big, the mini just a bit too small... 

Battery is not really an issue, I can plug during the day if necessary.

I currently have an iphone 6s with 64gb. Im upgrading to a 12 pro max soon. All this while, i thought i would be fine with 128gb but im starting to doubt myself. Im thinking i should get 256 gb especially since i read a lot, would love to download my stuff from netflix so i can watch it offline, i screenshot a million things a day, i would definitely want to take more pictures and videos now and i play games quite a bit. With my current phone, i always have to delete my games to make way for a newer app or a much needed app. Not only that, i also plan to keep this phone for the next 4-5 years, which is what i did with the 6s. Do you think 128 would be enough or 256 is a better option for me?

\-Fluidity: Everything Just works. I still haven't finished setting up all my apps but everything just works. Transition was easy and it is very easy to use. 

\-Speakers: They sound very good. Don't know how to describe but they are just so soothing. 

\-Screen: Just. A. Beauty. 

\-Cameras: With only 2 cameras, I can barley tell a difference to my friends s20 and my old one (cracked screen). Only place where I would say S20 wins is zoom since it has 30x. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things I don't like: 

\-Widgets: Yes there is widgets but the range of customization and support for apps I feel is still very low. Other than your big ones, you have no widgets for them. While on my android, lots of apps supported widgets. 

\-Notification: Do I have to even get started on this? 

Overall love the phone a lot, don't know the SOT yet but would give a solid 9/10

**QUESTION: I got a screen protector with no notch cover should I be worried? Would it be better if I went for a notch covered screen protector?**

Okay so I feel like I may be looking for something that doesnt exist. I like relatively slim cases, as I dont need the big bulky ones because I hardly ever drop my phone, and Ive got AppleCare for the rare occasions anything terrible happens. However, I almost exclusively use wireless charging and earbuds, so Im looking for a slim case that also covers the charging port/is dirt and dust proof. For some reason I collect a LOT of pocket lint it seems, and Id really rather keep it out of the speaker and charging port all together than to have to keep cleaning them. Any recommendations?

I am curious to know how easy it is for people to self-identify the screen issues on the iphone 12 phones - since there seems to be a ton of them. 

As a potential buyer, is this an issue that is apparent immediately upon using the device? Only in a side by side comparison? Or only under stress-testing situations (such as forcing a super low brightness in a dark room type setting)?

Curious to hear about how/when people discovered their screens had any build issues, OR better yet if your screen is perfect upon inspection!

(Side Note - had to ask this here because /r/iphone is a joke of a subreddit that refuses to let ANY questions be asked)

I have an iPhone 11 right now and am tempter to buy the 12 mini. The 11s size is mostly good for me. Sometimes I find it feeling too big and bulky but its not that bad. I just hate how I chose the black color. When dust gets under my clear case you can see everything. I tried the 12 mini at Target and it just feels better in the hand. I also like the screen. The oled looks much more vibrant and the bezels are so thin. Has anyone else upgraded from the 11 to the 12 mini, and is it worth it? Also I have a couple more questions. 

Is the smaller screen big enough for my usage? (scrolling social media, web browsing, watching videos from time to time)

Is it hard to get used to typing on the smaller screen?

Went to Apple Store today but they werent letting anyone in to hold the phones only order online and pick up.

Anyone else have their 12 Pro Max phone heating up? I use mobile data only (4G) and almost always screen on full brightness. I can feel the back of the phone heating up, it gets warm to the touch after I use for a straight hour or so, maybe more but not exactly sure. On another note it also gets really warm/ hot after charging, I use the normal Apple charger and it heats up the charger itself and phone, although I hear this is more common. I literally starting using it couple days ago and wonder if its normal to heat up/ warm on the back. Another note is that I since Ive used it, Im constantly on it throughout the day.

Currently have a rounded iPhone X and like the squared design more because it feels better and easier to hold but was wondering if you put on of Apples silicone or leather cases, does it feel any different compared to a round edge phone with a case?

When Im charging my iPhone using the 29w charger, it feels to get hot (hot to touch) especially in the top left of the display.

I tried to go into the Apple Store a few days ago but they refused to even replace my iPhone because the guy didnt find any issues with it or didnt believe I have any issues with it.

Im considering swapping my mini for a regular 12. Ive had the phone for two weeks now and unless Im home all day with no background activity I dont get all day battery life. Ive thought about making the battery life sacrifice for a better form factor but I plan to hold on to the phone for at least two years and I would rather stick with a phone for that long with a better battery life.
My concern about swapping is not seeing a significant increase in battery life from the mini.

Also I got this 18W type C plug from a third party seller so can I use that as well? I know it will charge slower compare to the OEM 20W

Has anyone noticed some fairly strong camera lens distortion on the x1 lens? For me, this happens at any distance and you can really notice it when you are at an angle, but it's also present when at a distance even when the phone is completely level with the horizon (the top of a door frame for instance).

Anyone else getting this?

Hey peepz

Ive currently got the iPhone 12 Pro Max, Ive only gone naked on the iPhone 7 because it wasnt a glass back!

Anyways Ive got AppleCare+ and Ive got a screen protector on, I really wanna go naked but Im just curious about some things.

How easy is it to crack the back glass? Either dropped or getting knocked against things.

How easy are the screen replacements when taken to Apple etc.

Thanks

There's no apple store near me so I bought it from the apple website. So I think I'd have to send it back to apple before they send me a new unit. The dust doesn't affect the image right now but it moves around and one of the specks is quite large so it could potentially interfere with pictures. Has anybody had experience with this? What happened? I'm debating leaving it but I'm bummed that my $1000+ phone has fucking dust in the part that it really shouldn't have dust in.

Hey, recent Android to iPhone convert here! Loving pretty much everything so far. One thing I cannot figure out is how to just SILENCE everything during the night. I'm doing something wrong and cannot figure out how the ringer switch, the do not disturb, and the volume rockers should be configured so that my alarm is still audible in the morning but everything else is silenced. 

On android this was a little more intuitive (to me at least).

For me, the first week I had my iPhone 12 pro max, it felt really big! 

But however when i received my apple leather case for it, it totally changed my experience. 

I can hold it much better, feels like I have much more grip on it. I dont have small hands, but it went from feeling to big to being perfect now.

Whats your experience?

You should know the SIM tray contains the serial number of the iPhone.

[https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204073#iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204073#iPhone)

It happened to me that my iPhone (I have an X) suddenly died and there was no way to resurrect it. I took it to the Apple store and the only way to retrieve the serial number was through the SIM tray.

I know, it's very an extreme and rare case but it could happen.

If you swap your SIM tray, I suggest anyway to make note of your serial number in case you need it and you cannot retrieve it from your iPhone.

I'm willing to pay for an app that does the same that Cycloramic (or similar apps) did back with the iPhone5.  


The iPhone 12 line has brought back an awesome design that can be used to take 360 pictures or videos with the vibration patterns.

So I'm a fan of folio cases for my phones but I'm having a hard time tracking down any information on which cases support the feature where it automatically turns on/unlocks your phone when you open the case.

I know not all folio cases support this because I've reached out to customer support for a couple of cases. The Pipetto Origami does not support smart unlock, the Otterbox ones do, but I'm not a huge fan of the design. 

Anyone know of where I can find this information? Or have a case that support this feature? I know the official ones supported it before, but there aren't any official folio cases from apple this time around (or at least not yet).

Hello all last Friday I picked up my Blue iPhone 12. I am coming from a Samsung Galaxy S9. I have owned many iPhones before that.

When I picked up the 12 from T-Mobile today the sales rep told me I have to use the new 18w apple adapter otherwise the older adapters will fry my battery. He claimed it happened to his friend the other week. I did not purchase the block from them.
Is it okay to charge the 12 with my 10watt adapter and older lighting cord?

Does a lower wattage mean a slower charge?

 Hello, first time poster and reader of this sub reddit, I am going to be upgrading from an iphone 7 to one of the iphone 12s. I am wondering what you think the best option for me is, what I usually do on my phone is watch hours and hours of youtube, a lot of social media, texting/calling, and pictures whenever I find something cool I want to take a picture of. (I am not into photography) I would also like the best phone that is future proofed in a way as I would be using this iphone for the next 3-5 years. I was planning on getting the max, but have watched many videos practically saying its not really worth it for my needs, so I guess im down to iphone 12 vs iphone 12 pro. If you could give me some reasons on why I should get which one you think would be worth it for me that would be great, and if you really feel passionate about the 12 pro max let me know why. (sorry for this being a jumbled mess)

 I created an app that can read and verify the personal data on passports using the secure chip embedded inside.

The app works by first using the camera to scan the passports data page, a step that is needed because the key used for reading the embedded chip is constructed out of the visible printed passport data. Then it will read and verify the embedded chip and display the extracted information.

Here is a 30 second demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTdpOcG1NSw

I am looking for users/testers with different passports to try it out. I wanted to see if my weekend hackathon project actually works or if it is only my passport and my friends that works. I made some speed improvements/bug updates.

The app is available for both iOS and Android and requires an NFC-enabled device (most modern Android devices and all iPhones starting with the iPhone 7 are NFC-enabled). You will also need a biometric passport (sometimes called electronic passport) that you can read. Most modern passports issued today are biometric passports, and you can verify this by looking for a microchip icon usually printed on the passport cover. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/biometric-passport-reader/id1510585886
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.iris

**Feel free to use an invalid passport, the app does not send any personal data, and it has been manually reviewed by Apple and Google**

On my S10+ I could take close up selfies that were crisp enough to see the pores on my skin but on the 12 pro it seems like the camera doesnt even focus unless your face is 1-2 feet away from the camera.

Is there something I am missing or is that just how the camera is?

Ive had my X for almost 4 years now. I was thinking of upgrading soon to the Blue iPhone 12. My biggest current issue with the X is the battery life, its currently at 84% health and on an average consumption day I would have to charge it at least twice. I really like the OLED screens which is why Im not considering the 11 due to the LCD screen. 

I also considered the iPhone 11 Pro but seems like the iPhone 12 is capable of the same things if not more, other than the camera aspect.

Long story short, I lost all my backups and only had my mp3s (from ripping all my CDs 15 years ago) on my iphone XS. I also had several hundred songs that I've purchased from iTunes over the years on my XS. Upgrading to the 12, I wanted to backup my XS to my macbook and then restore on the 12 from that back up. Did that, and look at the Music app on the iPhone 12 and only the purchased songs are on there. This has happened before, so I went to figure out a way to transition my songs from the XS to the macbook, and all of the songs that I ripped so long ago are gone - as well as song ratings, playlists, etc...

On the phone with apple support now who are giving me the runaround. But let me be clear. Apple's software has deleted files on my phone without notification while I went to back up those files. I expect they will try to tell me copyright infringement, but I purchased those CDs, personally ripped to mp3, and they've deleted my data without my consent. They're incentivized to get me to subscribe to apple music, but I can't justify that cost compared with the very little cost of the occasional new album. But to delete data without explanation is pure horse hockey.

Hi guys, sorry if this post doesn't belong here.  I just found out that the camera on my iphone 12 (which I bought on November 1) has a broken lens. It has a hole in the glass, but the camera works fine. I feel quite badly because I have never broken anything on an iPhone and I know is not cheap to fix, so I have many questions about this, I hope you can help me:

   1) I am still in time to buy the Apple Care insurance, but I called Apple and they told me that now I cannot buy it because the phone is already broken. I do not know what to do, should I just try to hire the insurance and say that my phone is gone? First I tried making an appointment at the Apple store to see the price of the repair but then I canceled it, I don't want it to be in their records that my phone is broken, although I don't know if this was already saved in my personal record when I called. 

   2) The camera works fine, but I want to repair it soon so that it does not get damaged either.  I have put a small piece of cardboard (I cut it from a pills box) in my case to cover the camera part. I don't know if this will be ok or if it's better to use another thing?

   3) I tried also to contract the insurance plan of my telco operator (Vodafone) through the website but I don't know if they need to see the phone before approving it.  Do you know anything about this?

   4) I called a 3rd party store that fixes iPhones but I don't know if after repairing it with them I won't be able to take out any insurance because Apple / Vodafone will find out that the iPhone  was repaired by a third-party.

   5) Has this happened to anyone?  I couldn't believe this morning when I saw the broken lens, I had an iPhone 7 for 4 years that went through everything and the camera doesn't even have a scratch.  I didn't drop my iPhone 12, It must have hit the keys in my purse or something. I dont even leave my house often because I am quarantining, meaning Im not sick but I work from home so I go out only to get groceries. Is the camera really that weak?  Is it because my iPhone was faulty? Can I do something about it if thats the case? Is it happening in other iPhones, like the bendgate years ago? Should we sue apple for breaking our dreams after paying for a 959 phone? 

Many thanks for reading all this  I hope your day is better than mine so far.

Does anyone experience charging problems with old charging cables? For some reason when I charge my iPhone12 itll says its charging but its not increasing rather decreasing (from usage use?). Or itll increase for x minutes but when I wake up in the morning it didnt charge at all?!  Is it a cable issue or the phones busted? I never had problems charging with my iPhone6s using the same cables. 

Is it because of the new USB-C head and Ill have to replace all of my outlets and cables?

Actually I should mention its happened a few times with my new regular iPad (8/10? idk) as well. 

If this is an issue, should I go directly to Apple for both products or my cellular carrier and Apple for each item?

Sorry for the dumb questions but you guys seem like the best to ask. So thanks in advance!

Juts bought the iPhone 12 2 weeks ago. All of a sudden today I notice colored spot showing RGB colors on screen for couple pixels areas. Not sure what and why. No fall, drop or any other mishandling. has a spigen temper and case on. It doesn;t get caught in screenshot. 

I have heard of iPhone 12 display issue. but this one seems different. However, it seems purely a device/screen issue. Any experience/thoguths?

Deciding between Spigen's screen protector and Whitestone for my 12 PM. What do you guys prefer?

Both of them have the notch cutouts, I'm not sure if I'll like that, but I'll take whatever doesn't interfere with the FaceID experience

I noticed though that Spigen has the price listed as $34.99 on the website, but it's $12.99 on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Tempered-Protector-designed-Friendly/dp/B08DQGH9T1/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=EZ+FIT+GLAS.tR+SLIM&amp;qid=1606280780&amp;sr=8-2), am I to believe these are the same products?

Just got an iPhone 12 (after hanging on to my iPhone 5 for what feels like decades) and am looking for an app that will let me swap backgrounds in portrait mode. It seems like an obvious thing to do since the iPhone software does such a good job of knocking out the background already, any leads? Right now I'm just masking my subject out and putting it on my background layer in Procreate on my iPad, but wondering if there's a quicker way with maybe some faked lighting for the scene. Or is this asking too much...

Go caseless from the start, that is. I tried it on my 12 pro and it ended up slipping off my lap onto the concrete and I now have a small ding in the frame. Luckily it was nothing worse. I find that anytime my phone is without a case I end up dropping it in the dumbest of situations. And I have this general sense of doom and anxiety. The screen protector and case combo just makes me feel so good and secure. I like being able to set my phone down on tables and surfaces without abandon. And I have AppleCare+. Mad respect to you guys!! I did end up going without a case and screen protector on my X 2.5 years after getting it. I think at a certain point my anxiety disappears and my carelessness and accidental dropping of my phone goes with it. Like I somehow end up being more careful with it even tho its older and more scratched at that point. With a new phone I just cant seem to do it!

I bought an 11 last week and it's great, but I seriously love the square design of the 12. The 11 feels a bit big for me, and the bezels. The more research into OLED I do the more problems I come across. If i was to spend almost one thousand euros on an iPhone I would expect to have it for at least three years, but this doesn't seem to be the case with the burn in of OLED screens. I have also seen a lot of posts about PWM and this has been another concern.

Has anyone here got long term experience with an OLED iPhone and are these issues worth keeping the 11 for or should I swap for the 12 before the return window is closed?

So my IPhone 12 Pro Max screen has a flickering issue and instead of pure blacks (OLED) I see a white greyish or green glow on black screen video and also while booting up the phone. This happens when I am below 90% brightness 
Is it a hardware problem or a software ?

I have a 12 Pro, coming from an 11 Pro Max.

I was able to do PiP just fine on my 11 PM with majority of the streaming apps I use (Hulu, Netflix, etc).

But I just tried to do it on my 12 Pro just now (I checked in the General Settings, PiP is on), and it just closes out the video instead of doing a PiP.

Its a weird little luxury Ive found nice in using every now and then so its a bummer its not working for me anymore.

Sorry to bother you guys again, but I have some questions before I go on and return my iPhone 12.

For people that replaced their iPhone (12, 12 pro, 12 pro max) after having the flickering issue:

\- after getting it replaced did you stop seeing the flickering thing happening on your new device? Try the volume thing as well, explained below

\- do black images look as if you're screen is turned off or you still see the screen as if its still on? Black images are supposed to look as if the screen is turned off

To check for flickering watch this video ( [https://youtu.be/AjWfY7SnMBI](https://youtu.be/AjWfY7SnMBI) ) in the youtube app, not here or safari, rotate your device in the horizontal view and make sure all lights are turned off in the room and your phone has low brightness (turn off True Tone and Night mode) and check if turning the volume up or down shows a greenish line on one of side of the screen , while watching the video. If yours doesn't do any of this, when did you get yours? Trying to understand whether this is something they are resolving in the new batch.

Hi all, anybody else having this issue? Ive had my 12 since launch day. About a week ago for the first time I had an issue where the screen froze up for a couple of seconds and then the phone reset. That time, it reset about 3 times in a row. Since then, its reset maybe once every 1.5 days just randomly when loading something - for example, it just did it when I was sending my friend a text. Super weird and a bit concerning for a brand new phone.

So I'm getting a regular 12 next week and I definitely want to get one of Apple's MagSafe cases.

Now my favorite tbh would be the Clear version. I don't mind the white circle at all and I really want to be able to see the blue colour of the phone.

But in the first 1-2 weeks there were a couple reports of people's cases cracking after mere days of use. Has anyone had similar experiences or are the cases actually good to go?

I have the 12 mini and noticed that I have a lot less reception than my other phones albeit this is the only one with 5G. On the others, I get full bars (4 bars on 1st SE, for example) connected to 4G but with the 12 mini, I only get 2, at most, 3. I tried switching back and forth between the two but the signal strength stays the same. I pretty wuch don't know anything about wireless connections but it feels like it's not actually switching from a 5G connection to a 4G. Is this normal? Is there anyway to "force" 4G?

Ive noticed that almost every case other than the super bulky ones (like Otterbox Defender) have a raised lip around the camera, like apples silicone case and the Otterbox symmetry. This is good of course because you dont want the camera to get scratched, but doesnt that mean when you put your phone down on a table its unbalanced since the lip around the camera is not leveled with the rest of the phone? As someone who tends to have their phone flat on a desk when using it for a lot of things, is this just something Ill have to accept? Im hesitant to purchase the Symmetry or silicon case for this reason, but Im not sure I like the defender I have. With the defender when I press the top right side of the screen (opposite the opening for the camera) sometimes I can feel the phone shifting in the inner case.

Has anyone used Rhinoshields impact transparent skin on the back of their iPhones? Being how good the 12 feels and looks. Im going caseless this time around. With the impact skin itll provide a lot more drop and shatter resistance. Wanted to see if anyone is using it or has used it on previous iPhone models. Its not edge to edge so Im in hopes it doesnt look too ugly or how well the skin adhere to the back frosted glass. https://i.imgur.com/amUYicZ.jpg

I have the mini but this would be applicable to all. On mine between the lenses somehow small micro scratches have appeared. Not sure if I caused them or if they were there when I bought the phone. I have a case on the phone. I come from an SE 2016 so I admit Im still in that obsessive phase but its something I wanted to check with others on. Its not super noticeable unless in direct light. It doesnt seem like they can be felt so its just a soft material possibly. Im thinking Ill get Apple care just in case this could affect the lenses themselves so I wont worry too much.

Hey guys, i am a small Tech YouTuber and after using the iPhone 12 Pro Max for a week, i have somethings to say about it.

Although iPhone 12 pro max battery has been so far amazing and i can't say so for the rest of the phone.

This phone is horrible, it costs 989 for the 128gb model, and in my country (Italy, so not a 3rd world country) it does not have the millimiter wave 5g. 989 for a new apple phone that is literally trash. I just bought a refurbished 8plus for 359. And i think i am going to keep that when it arrives. Sorry for the rant, but clearly apple is starting to get a little lazy because of lack of competition in its field, what do you guys think?

Today I saw iPhone 12 mini on the Croma store, man it's very tiny... I can barely feel it in my hands, I just wondered how it equips all the components like the 12 &amp;  has few compromises I.e battery.
My question is how's the battery life so far. Did you get any feeling like something is missing in your pocket and you tend to notice that the phone is present and realized that it is too lightweight? 

I have this feeling with my Galaxy j2 2018.

Okay here are my thoughts on 12 pros, I watched tons of reviews on 12 and 12 Pro, here's I have noticed
12 is good for 1-2 years but I feel 12 pros extra RAM helps in fluid performance, don't get me wrong 12 is very good. But many developers will focus on AR in upcoming years so that, an extra 2GB of RAM will serve your needs. 

And I heard that many people are complaining about the 4Gb ram as it's loading or not keeping effectively in the background. 
And PRO RAW is coming later in the next update that's a bonus if you are into photography.

I'd love to hear your thoughts too. Thanks and have a great day.

I see so many on here complain their screen is yellow and they want to take it back, why would you go through this hassle when you will 1) get a refurb, 2) probably get the same screen, 3) have to go Genius, when you can adjust the colour temperature exactly to your liking and combine it with True Tone to make it look more natural. I have been doing this for years now and it's great how now you can make the screen look colder if you don't like the yellow tint.

Hello,

I have a dilemma that I need you guys to help me solve. Should I buy iPhone 12 Pro Max, and use it as my only device for media consumption, gaming, chatting etc. Or should I buy iPhone 12 mini as my daily driver and wait for an iPad Mini 6 for media consumption &amp; gaming?

When I was at the Apple store and held iPhone 12 mini in the hands, I felt excited! Not so much for the iPhone 12 Pro Max - it was massive!

So please, give me some of your thoughts about this matter. Thank you!

P.S.: I have also bought Apple Watch 6 (GPS only), to quickly glance at incoming messages, calendar notifications and use it for health tracking (running mainly).

Be careful with your lenses! Somehow Ive already managed a scratch near the edge of the ultra wide lens on my 12 Pro Max. 

I have it in a case that has a lip to protect the lenses, but it may have happened when I was cleaning smudges off, despite being very careful with the tools and method.

Even being a photographer for years, I never managed to scratch a lens just by cleaning it. I try to avoid cleaning lenses at all, but fingerprint smudges are the worst for image quality. Bummed.

 I just moved from the 11 pro to the 12 pro max and one of the first things I noticed is that the speakers produce more noticeable vibration/resonance when holding the phone especially when playing back voices on things like youtube videos. Not a ton, but definitely more noticeable.

I was wondering if this is a consequence of a bigger phone, the different design of the 12, or just different speakers.

Has anyone noticed this same thing?

tl;dr The title

When I got my phone a few weeks back, my computer recognized the iPhone, but iTunes did not despite recognizing my X and iPad Pro. Ironically enough, the only cable to work was the very USB-A cable they no longer provide with iPhones. The thought of almost losing 250 GB of data almost caused me to riot.

Anyway with that in mind, iTunes is dead to me and I upgraded from the 200 GB iCloud plan (which I only use to sync about 170 GB of photos and videos between my iPad and iPhone) to the 2 TB plan so I could use iCloud Backups for the time being.

I do have a few concerns about iCloud Backup, a few being that it's not end-to-end encrypted (the messages in particular), the fact that I'm paying $84 more a year to do something I used to do for free for 8 years, and that with the amount of data I have on my phone, it would be a ***lot*** of data being used in a world with data caps. But I understand there's a price for convenience, and being able to restore a backup on my phone from anywhere be it at home, the next state over or overseas when I travel (assuming I lose my phone and gotta take out the backup iPhone) is definitely useful.

Now for iMazing. I was looking into getting it because iExplorer just doesn't work well with my data hoarding ass. Backing up more messages than it can handle will crash the software, and trying to transfer 170 GB of photos/videos will crash the software (iCloud for Windows is a joke as well, where a bug wasted 500 GB of my data trying to download a single file).

I heard good things about iMazing, and also found out that it can not only do backups, but it can do them wirelessly. I think the downsides are that you still have to use a wire for the actual restore from backup and you ***have*** to be at home to restore from backup, but I wouldn't really have to worry about paying $84 a year extra (the licenses cost far less down the line), burning through 250 GB of my data cap re-downloading everything or about the lack of end-to-end encryption.

Since iMazing's backup capabilities wasn't the main reason I was buying it, I still wouldn't exactly mind having the 2 TB iCloud plan for redundancy purposes since my jobs in tech have always emphasized redundancy and having backups in separate locations. I've dealt with corrupted backups before, so having one on my computer (in the event that I don't want to blow my data cap) and one in the Cloud (in the event something happens to my PC or I'm not home) seems promising. However at the end of the day, money plays a factor here. 

Thanks in advance!

So, I got a new ipad at the same time I got my iphone 12. At first I thought my 12 screen was a little off, but I adjusted rather quickly. However, now that i've started using my new ipad air 4 pretty often, the screen difference between the 2 is incredibly noticeable. The ipad air is crystal clear and makes the iphone either look blue with true tone off or yellow with true tone on. Should this be expected? Are the ipad screens supposed to be considerably better than the phones?

I just did a slew of these green flicker tests and the only one that showed anything was watching a black video on YouTube in full screen and changing the volume. 

I was a little confused because it only happened in this case and not in the others that were suggested. 

So I decided to do the same test on my old 8+. Guess what, it does the same (its less visible because it isnt perfect black), but theres a gradient behind that volume control UI. The grey line across the top is totally normal. There are many ways to test for green flicker, this isnt one...

Proof: [It shows up on a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/kKg7rkK.jpg)

So I seem to have a good unit. Its a normal 1/ and I just got it on Friday so it may actually be a hardware issue that was resolved by the time mine was produced.

So, PSA: If you can only see it behind the volume bar in the YouTube app and nowhere else, youre fine :)

Ive been to the apple store more times this month than probably my whole adult life. Half of those were me just waiting in line for them to tell me there are no geniuses available. I have the screen flicker on blacks issue AND my screen is warmer than Id like (my X looks like an LCD next to it when it comes to whites). Today I walked in once again hoping to finally solve this with a walk in genius appointment and all they could tell me was that apple is aware and software update should solve it. There wasnt anything else they could do for me according to them. I go to the display phones and literally all of them have better screens than mine. I asked a rep and they said that those phones are using demo software (obviously). And when I pointed out the difference they couldnt give me a good reason why. So how is it software based if I would literally take any of those display phones over mine? Sorry for ranting im just so tired of this shit.

As the title says, I've spent the past MONTH trying to pick between the red or white iPhone 12. I'm leaning towards the white, but I need help. Seriously can't decide. I have a silver aluminum AW6 on the way, so fortunately neither color will "clash" with silver. 

Sorry if this isn't allowed-- I've been scouring the "search" tab for individual posts of the colors in action, but I honestly think just having a DUMP of photos will help  

P.S. -- Bonus points if any of you have the green or saddle brown cases on your phones! Those two are my cases in the running...

I haven't used the new cable that came with the 12 series, so I was wondering if it is worth it to get a new adapter for the USB-C cable. I have 3 lightning chargers and a wireless charger, so I'm not pressed for chargers I just like to have options.

I have a Galaxy S10 I got last summer but I really want to switch to the iPhone 12 Pro because of the ecosystem (I have a MacBook and an iPad), the camera (I'm especially excited for night photography) and well, the aesthetic of it. I think it looks really sleek. 

Now, what's really keeping me from buying one is because of the high price tag. Will it be really that much better than what I already have? Will it be worth shedding more than 1000 dollars on a new phone despite having a decent, fully-functioning phone?

I decided to take a walk on the wild side and get a red phone because Ive always gotten black. The red is beautiful! I love it outside of a case. 

I only carry my phone and my keys, so Ive used a stick on wallet in the past. However, Im having a hard time finding a good color combo with the Apple products. Im open to a clear case but then Im thinking the wallet will look awkward on top of a clear case AND Ill be limited to a black mag wallet. 

I dont really want to resort to black on red... 
Red 12 owners, what are you doing about cases and mag wallets?

I have an iPhone SE 2020 in perfect condition that I want to trade in for the 12 Pro Max. 

Most of the carrier offers at this point give trade in credits over 24-36 months. I am planning to move overseas in 6-10 months. I am planning to buy the 12 pro max by paying in full.

Do you know/have you seen, any offers around Black Friday(or Christmas) that gives the trade in credits instantly when ordering?

Thanks for the help.

I am curious if there was something different done behind the screen to make its quality better on the 12 series. 

I have an 11 Pro Max and a 12 pro and I swear the screen quality on the 12 pro is much better.
Or is it possible its just my mind playing tricks on me? Or is the size difference what makes the 12 look better?

My current phone (Samsung j4 prime I believe) has a 3300Mah battery. The battery on my phone is absolute shit, I've had the phone less than 2 years as it was my first phone and the battery has deteriorated now where I have to charge it at least once throughout the day on top of charging it overnight minimum. I'm considering buying the iPhone 12 pro and I noticed the battery is smaller than my current phones battery, I assume they have everything better optimised so the battery lasts longer but I'm still wondering if even tho the iPhone battery is smaller will it last longer than my current phone's. 

Thanks

Im looking at the $800 trade in promo for the 12 pro, but it says you need to complete all the trade in steps during the promotional period, which includes activating the new phone on ATT &amp; sending in your trade in. The problem is, it doesnt say how long the promo period is, and the phone wont even arrive to me for a week from now. Im worried it would arrive, I go to activate it on ATT, and the trade in promo will already have expired. Neither best buy or ATT support is live :/

Does anyone else have this issue or is it just me? I wanted to see if it was a design issue.

Pay attention to the screen of your new iPhone 12. It probably **displays some weird green tint on it when you use your phone in a dark environment**!

&amp;#x200B;

I bought an iPhone 12 over one week ago, but soon I found a lot of people in China are complaining about the screen of their new phone. **When you put a pure grey image on the screen, you may find there is some strange green color patch showed on the display.** Then I checked my phone, and unfortunately, my phone has the same issue.

&amp;#x200B;

The posted two photos are both taken by a mirrorless camera with a 30-second exposure, so the problem may be somewhat exaggerated by a long exposure, but it does exist. The green screen photo is the result after I turned on 100% Reduce White Point, which can be set in Settings-&gt;Accessibility-&gt;Display &amp; Text Size. This green tint can be clearly seen by human eyes. Another photo is the result of a normal screen setting. You can see the green on the upper side and the red on the lower side of the screen. However, it is hard to sense this unevenness by human eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

**The method to test your own phone** is like this:

1) Stay in a completely dark environment;

2) Turn off true tone and night shift; set Brightness below 50%;

3) Open a dark grey (not pure black) image and check if there is a strange green tint.

Some users can obviously find the green patch after these three steps. This is serious since it may affect daily use.

If you don't, try to turn on 100% Reduce White Point (Settings-&gt;Accessibility-&gt;Display &amp; Text Size), and do the three steps again. If you still cannot find any issue, then you are really a lucky dog!

(You can also watch this youtube video explaining how to test your phone:  [https://youtu.be/XOa316DAH-o](https://youtu.be/XOa316DAH-o))

&amp;#x200B;

It seems **this problem is very common among all lines of iPhone 12, including 12/mini/pro/pro max**. Tons of users in China have reported this issue, and flock into the apple store to return or replace the phone. However, when I went to the apple store this morning to return my phone, the guy who serviced me said he never heard this before. I bet the same issue also exists in iPhone 12 sold in the US since these phones are manufactured in the same place during the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

**The good news is that Apple has admitted this problem, and is actively investigating it (**[**https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/18/apple-investigating-iphone-12-display-issues/**](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/18/apple-investigating-iphone-12-display-issues/)**).** I really hope Apple can soon give its customers a satisfactory solution. But for now, you really need to think twice before buying a new iPhone 12. If you have bought an iPhone 12 and also found this issue, you may need to decide if you return/replace it or not. I know it's so troublesome, but I finally made up my mind because I saw a lot of people complaining that the green tint will become larger and deeper gradually (I don't know if this is a fact, but better sorry than regret). I will wait until Apple has solved this issue.

Does apple care plus give me 3 years in total coverage for my iPhone? So the one year that apples gives by default and an additional 2 years if I pay $199?

Or does it only give me an additional 1 year only on top of the default 1 year. So 2 years in total?

I just  realized  that the iPhone 12, which I got nearly a  week ago, allows  for  2.x optical zoom...OUT. I don't know how I missed it in all of the videos I watched but I somehow did and am disappointed I cannot zoom in even 2x  before photo quality degrades. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never even knew optical zoom out was a thing. So, what I want to know is if it's THAT big of  a deal. How much  does the photo  quality for those of you who own a  Pro  or Pro Max degrade once you zoom in past  2x (I read at least the Pro allows for 4x optical zoom)?

&amp;#x200B;

Is the quality at those options or beyond them so significantly better  that it would justify trying to exchange the 12 and pay more?

&amp;#x200B;

I had the opportunity to get a 12 Pro but the wait was over a  month long and I just didn't want to deal with my carrier again because there is ALWAYS some issue with them -- literally every single time I go  there something bad happens.

Hi everyone, I want to tell you about my experience with the iPhone 12 Pro Max and the screen problems I had.  

I come from Android and I pre-ordered iPhone 12 Pro Max and received it on the day of release, November 13th.  
I almost immediately noticed that the display had much warmer tones than normal and the True Tone is therefore almost unusable. 

As if that wasnt enough, when I am in a completely dark room blacks are not completely black, but they have a green tint and flickering. The problem does not seem as serious as the videos I saw online, it is almost imperceptible and you just need another light source in addition to the iPhone display to stop seeing it.  

Since I had these problems, I booked an appointment at the Genious Bar, where I explained what was wrong with my display and then the technician did various functional tests. 
The tests gave positive results for a 100% perfect device and the technician did not want to proceed with a replacement or repair.  However, he explained to me that I have another 6 days to return the iPhone if I'm not satisfied.  

The problem is that apart from the screen, the phone is perfect and I am satisfied, but in the long run I don't know if and how these problems could be solved.  

Have you had any problems with your display?  
How did you solve them or what will you do to solve them? 


TLDR: My iPhone 12 Pro Max has issues with the display and Apple refuses to fix it. I need advices on what to do.
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-11-21
I like it for the size but Im not sure if the regular 12 has better features and stuff or if its the exact same as the mini just bigger? I currently have the iPhone X. Id prefer whichever has the better camera probably. But for other features I usually only use my phone for texting and social media.

I love the baltic blue leather case on my blue 12 pro. But being my first Apple leather case, I cant help but notice it almost always feels sticky. 

My hands dont seem overtly sweaty, but it does tend to be less sticky immediately after I wash my hands.

Is this a me thing or a leather case thing?
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-11-21
I've upgraded from a 11 Pro to a 12 mini and had a basic plastic case on my 11 as the phone would nearly slip out of my hand without one.

The 12 mini is perfect for me - I always loved the 4/5/original SE flat design and size, so I didn't hesitate to buy a decent case this time.

My problem is, the phone keeps trying to move out of the case after being in my pocket, no doubt being slightly compressed out of it when sat down.

My point is, I'm sure the keynote implied that the phone is magnetically held into the case, but this doesn't appear to be the case. I felt no magnetic force when putting the phone in the case (it did detect it on screen with the MagSafe animation). It looks like its pretty much held in by the side friction and the side buttons.

Is that your experience or is mine defective? I keep having to push the phone back into the case at the top and bottom when its been in my pocket.

Hello, 

This is the debate of a lifetime concerning me. I plan to get the iPhone 12 Pro Max by Christmas, and I'm still hesitating about which protection model to choose (compromise between elegance and protection): Should I banish silicone? In my head, silicone hangs in jeans pockets, deforms over time and above all is a real nest of dust. Is this really the case? What do you think about it? Is the apple silicone case a dust magnet? Thank you.

Initially, I was very tempted and almost set on getting 12 mini because of the size.

But I ended up getting a regular 12 for 3 reasons:

**1. Haptics and Vibration**

I know from the teardown that the mini has a smaller haptic engine but was convinced it wouldnt make a difference since the phone body was smaller.

Tested both regular and mini at the store and constantly feel that the minis vibration is just a tad weaker. The mini is like a ripple while the regular is stronger and more like a rumble. 

**2. Speakers**

Again, some reviews mentioned the minis speakers are bit softer but no overall difference. I tried both at the store and realized the mini sounds overall about 1 to 1.5 steps softer than the regular (I guess thats expected?) but at the same time the mini constantly sounds sharper/shriller and not in a good way.

**3. UI around the Notch**

So I noticed the minis notch is the same size as the regular and didnt think much. At the store and from the Xcode mock ups, however, I noticed the minis UI is... uglier?

The GPS icon touches the left side of the notch, while the signal bar touches the right side of the notch. Its almost like there is no space for the icons and everything at the status bar looks squished and unpleasant.



**What I hope to see in the 13 mini**

1. Smaller notch so the status bar has some breathing space 
2. A nerf to the network (e.g. no ultra mmwave or whatever it is) and slightly thicker body so we get high battery and more importantly, the same haptic engine as the rest.

I was so excited for the mini and its in-hand feel is just beyond comfortable, but the reasons above made me go for the regular 12 instead. Curious to know what you guys think!

I just off the phone with a Senior Advisor in regards to the screen yellowing issue. So I thought Id share the information here with you guys.

Here is what she said in a nutshell, make of it what you will:

-	Apple makes three screen types by intention: Bluish, warmish, and transparent (they have internal codenames for each which I forget)

-	The new iPhones, by design, are equipped with the warmish panels

-	It is not a defect

-	She understood my pain regarding the fact that this makes the colours inaccurate, especially so for photographer/designer types like myself

-	She suggested that I stick with the Colour Tint workaround and that a replacement wouldnt solve much since this is the de facto for the new iPhones

-	She said that she will surely forward my feedback to the internal team regarding apple letting users choose between a default Warm and Neutral setting, instead of having to rely on the the Colour Tint workaround (since that is unwieldy and reduces the native brightness a bit)

The takeaway is that if you want an iPhone 12, you need to accept that they come with yellowish displays.

I think this whole situation is crazy levels of horseshit, especially when Apple is famous for being a design and precision-oriented company whose target audience is creative people.

But... the fact that the yellow can be offset via Colour Tint gives me hope. As long as they acknowledge their mistake in the way that theyve calibrated these displays while providing an official software-enabled switch to neutralise the colours for those prefer that (without losing brightness) - I have no issues.

To make this happen though, it would require that we bombard their online feedback portal with this specific request:

My iPhone has an unnaturally yellow tint. It cannot show pure white! It seems that an unrelated setting under accessibility is able to help but at the cost of some brightness. This shouldnt be the case at all on such a premium product. So please add the ability to neutralise the yellow without brightness loss as a new official setting within iOS.

Hello! I need some help, to know if it is safe to use the charger and power bank that I have on my iPhone 12. 

The charger gives up to 46W of power, and power bank up to 30W. I bought this for my iPad Pro 2018, and was told that it is safe to use. But is it also ok for the new iPhone? I was told before and also read online, that both the iPhone and the chargers (AUKEY brand, so a good one I think, links below) give and receive only as much power as they can, by some kind of safe measures put in there. Anyone know anything about this? I just dont want to have to buy a new charger just for the iPhone, but I also dont want to hurt the battery of the phone. Please be so kind and help me out!

This is probably gonna sound dumb but I'm having a slight hardware issue with my new iPhone 12 and I've seen a handful of others experiencing the same issue online. The volume up button sits slightly lower than the volume down button and is very noticeably less tactile and responsive, it still works but the problem is using the phone with a case. With no case the problem is barely noticeable and with thin non-protective cases the issue is only slightly magnified but still very annoying, still able to feel and hear feedback but only about half as much as I would with the volume down button. With more protective cases which already make the buttons harder to press and feel, the volume up button is basically useless. Online people have said they had their phone replaced because of this and there was no issues with the new phones, but others also stated their replacement phones had the same issue. I can't go through my carrier to get a replacement model since I'm past the 14 days, but could I still go to an AASP and see if I can get the phone repaired or replaced with them?

So, heres the thing guys, my country is always known for ludicrously offering incredible data caps unlike almost all countries around the world that supposedly doesnt...

5G has always been a postpaid plan in my country. However, due to the recent release of iPhone 12/12 Pro, the telecom carrier that Im with has just announced its first ever prepaid line of 5G that offers 500GB at an incredibly low price without any commitments whatsoever!!

My question is, given that right now anybody can access 5G in my country, is it going to be the same as 4G LTE ? To rephrase it, as more 5G users increase, will it disrupt the speed? Or is this no longer seen as an issue anymore?

Before todays announcement of 5G Prepaid, the highest speed I get everyday was between 600 to 800 on download &amp; 50 to 120 on upload. To reach 1Gbps I would have to be next to the tower...I know some people who live 2 kilometers near the tower and are getting 1Gbps almost everyday. Oh and the ping here is always between 9ms to 13ms.

Should be noted that our 5G is a Sub-6Ghz and not the MmWave like Verizon.

I look forward to hearing your views :)

As a iPhone 7 user with 76% battery health and looking forward to upgrade I'm still not sure which one to get and I need to know people's experience and advise coming from a iPhone 7 (or similar for that matter)

I need a phone that will be functional for 4-5 years. Budget only covers either a 64 GB iPhone 12 or a 128 GB iPhone 12 Mini (could even go for a 64GB Mini). Love the size of the 7 but I'm already hating the battery life. I like the idea of the Mini's size, but I'd could go for a larger display + better battery. I'm used to administrate only 32 GB of memory and I mainly use the phone for Twitter, Whatsapp, Reddit, ocasional photos, some Youtube, browsing, playing Pokemon Go and Dominations with 4-6 SOT average daily. No 5G  yet on my country so that's out of the picture.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help will be welcomed

I'm using a Spigen screen protector on my pro max and I just noticed a small crack on the side which spread across the screen. I've never dropped it, I'm super gentle and I don't know how this could have happened.

I try to keep my battery in good shape when I am able to (which is much easier these days when I'm home more often because of quarantine and I work from home, less so when I was traveling or away from home and needed all the battery I could get), so at home in the living room I have my wireless charger turn on when my battery hits under 40% and turn off when my battery hits 80%.

However my wireless charger in the bedroom just stays on the entire time. Normally not an issue with my previous phone since it'd just cut off at 80% until I was about to wake up, but about a week later it's still just immediately charging to 100%.

I have all the necessary settings enabled so I know it's just trying to "learn" first but how long is that supposed to take? I have a fairly consistent wake up schedule during the week and I use the Bedtime feature so it knows when I'm going to wake up via alarm.

So is there a certain amount of days before it kicks in?

Hey everyone,

My 12 pro max is on the way and I'm aware that when a new iPhone comes out, apps might look a little odd (Instagram stories being too zoomed in for example). Is that the case for you? One of the reasons why I'm switching from Android back to the IOS is because I miss the way social media apps and YouTube used to look on my old 6. Also speaking of YouTube, I've watched a bunch of tech review videos and it seems like none of the reviewers cared about that. I wonder why.


So: How is the app optimization on your iPhone 12 pro max thus far?

Ive been doing some research to decide which to buy, the 11 family or 12 family. Lots of people say that the iPhone 12 pro max has a good battery life for screen time, video playback, and photos. However, its gaming capacity pales in comparison to the 11s battery life. Is that true?

Sorry in advance for the long think piece. Here's my experience with Verizon as a new customer that ordered a iPhone 12 Pro Max.
I'm having data issues in Jacksonville, Fl. I just switched to Verizon on the Pro Max launch day and was shocked when I did a speed test and it came back with 3 MBPS on 4 bars of 5G. Me understanding that 5G speeds without ultra Wideband is somewhat of a gimmick I decided to toggle the phone to LTE only and actually got slower speeds than the 3 MBPS. I drove around my neighborhood and there was no change. Drove around my side of town and got decent speeds 15-20 MBPS within a 3 minute drive of my house. Called Verizon and spoke to a rep (I'll save the story for how bad the customer service is for another time) he said that he could put through an order for me to get a free signal booster....call dropped on my T-Mobile phone that I switched from before he was able to put through the order. Before the call was disconnected we did every troubleshooting step imaginable. I not only did a reset on my network settings but the entire phone numerous times. I Called back and waited for an hour but Tech 2 wasn't answering so I decided to go to the Verizon store and get a SIM card switch because I thought it may have just been faulty.
As I pull into the Verizon parking lot my speeds were booming over 50 MBPS the store rep said to disregard it because the store has signal boosters and its not a true reflection. He was very much so correct. He was hesitant to swap out my SIM card but I insisted because I need any solution possible to fix this train wreck. Before I leave the store he tries to sell me the same signal booster that I was offered for free for $300 . As I leave the store I have the same issue so I called back into tech support and now I'm being told that a ticket has to be put in before I can be approved for a signal booster. He puts in the ticket and states that by 11/17 I should get an answer. On 11/18 I called tech support again just to realize that the ticket was never put in and I'm having to start all over again. The new Tech 2 rep was great and thorough but said somethings that made me raise my eyebrow. According to him my phone is fine and doesn't need to be replaced but he mentioned that it looked as though I was being throttled like I went over 50 GB and was in a congested area. With me having the phone for less than a week and barely able to load a YouTube video that's impossible. He remote accessed my phone and literally watched as I did a speed test and was floored at the 1 MBPS speed on both 5G and LTE. He placed another ticket and stated that they'll reach out within 48-72 hours with a resolution hopefully. I grew anxious last night and did a chat with Verizon support through Twitter and was told that my house was literally in the middle of two towers and that I should have any issues according to the coverage map. The lies from the coverage map is what made me leave T-Mobile....tbh even with all that's going on I still wouldn't go back to them right now.
On 11/19 I noticed that in my settings it looked like I had a digital sim activated which is what I thought would be causing issues. Called tech support again and was told that everything is normal in their system. The tech checked on my ticket advised me that it was still open which was a good thing but also saw that there was a memo placed out on all iPhone 12 models. She stated that from what she could see it was related to data access and 5G availability and that they made Apple aware of the issues going on. She even cracked a joke that Verizon's infrastructure wasn't ready for all of the 5G phones being added to its network. At this point it's a waiting game....Call quality for me has been amazing in comparison to T-Mobile and the dropped calls that Ive had since April.

I currently have a xs max but I'm going to try to upgrade in December. I wanted an iPhone 12 because I liked the color and I kinda wanted to down size the screen but not by too much. The thing is that I've been hearing about all these issues and that the battery isn't good. So I'm thinking I should just get the 12 pro max instead.

What do you guys think? Has anyone here gone from a xs max to a  regular 12? Do you like it or do you think you should have waited for the 12 pro max?

Should I get IPhone 12 pro 256gb or IPhone max pro 128gb ???
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-11-20
I've been using the pro max for a week and I am still in love with the device. 

**Size:** At first the biggest adjustment was the weight. I thought the phone was a bit heavy and my pinky was getting tired (it still does a little bit). The overall size is wonderful; I love the large screen for streaming and reading. I've been using the phone without a case since launch, so caseless is actually the perfect size (I think a case would add bulk).

**Camera:** I haven't really tested the camera (I don't take a lot of pictures tbh) as much; I've taken a few photos here and there but no real shots. 

**Battery Life:** I'm a heavy user that uses my phone heavily throughout the day. I usually take my phone off the charger around 7 or 8 am. By 10pm my battery is at about 40%. With my 8 plus, I had to charge my phone throughout the day. My current battery life is light years better than it was before.

**Overall:** The phone is so gorgeous, I'm still in awe at how beautiful the phone is. The phone is super fast, seems to be much faster than my 8 plus. The screen even seems brighter. It could be that I am in the infatuation stage with the phone, but overall my experience has been positive.

&amp;#x200B;

How would you describe your experience with the 12 pro max and/or 12 mini after a week?

Hi curious if anyone in this group is facing issues with battery life. I am plugged in with the original 20W charger with the original usb c to lightning. But the battery life is not increasing when I am using it. If its just sitting with the screen switched off it will charge properly. 

Anyone else facing this issue? I dont recall having this issue in the past. When I charge my phone battery life will increase while charging even when charging :(

Bought a 12 Mini.

Love it. The cameras, the design, the speed. And not only the speed of the phone itself but also the connection of LTE (I dont use 5G because sub 6 isnt better in my experience). Coming from an iPhone SE (original) the improvement is HUUUGE.

Its amazing.

One thing Ive found though is that the display is now to big to use one-handed. I cant seem to hit the top left corner without almost dropping the phone. 

Its more of a gameboy then a remote control in usage I think, seeing it needs to be used two-handed to work. But thats ok. 

Only if there was a way to use it one-handed, that would really come in handy. There are lots of situations where you want to quickly look something up or do something and dont have more then one hand free.

Does any of you have any tips on handling the phone one handed, specifically reaching the top left corner of the screen?

Things to know:
-	tried reachability, because of case doest work consistently because of case
-	popsockets or cords arent really an option (I dislike them very much)
-	I stil want to securely hold my phone without it dropping, so I leave my pink under the phone.

If you have any ideas I would really love to know! Do you know anything I can try?

Are the cameras on the iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 exactly the same? Im asking because I recently purchased an iPhone 12 and I want to get a camera lens protector like [this ](https://www.amazon.com/OUNIER-Protection-Definition-Anti-Scratch-Compatible/dp/B081JP42F1/ref=mp_s_a_1_8?dchild=1&amp;keywords=iphone+11+camera+lens+protector&amp;qid=1605850032&amp;sr=8-8), but its for the iPhone 11

I just tried and it seemed to help when comparing to my other iPhone 12. Auto brightness turned off, no color filters, no night shift, True Tone off when I compared the two. 

Credit to comment made by u/quarter25packer where he went to an apple store and they did this for him. Thanks bud! 

Hopefully this helps someone else! Lmk if it does or Im just crazy/ blind lol.

I have owned an iPhone 6 since release date. It has become a bit laggy, but it's still a great phone (with a headphone jack) that gets my needs met. Really tempted by the 12 Pro though...so much so that I basically spent the past hour researching everything from colors to pricing options to edges to ram for the long term to just about everything. But at the end of the day do I really need to succumb to my American desires? At the same time, my 6 will only get slower and some apps are already requiring a minimum of  iOS 13 (which I can't upgrade to). If I do the upgrade plan though, I can land on one of the models and colors I think is great for long term use, and use it another six years. Thoughts?

I've watched a bunch of videos on the iPhone 12s gaming performance and in all of them it had frame rate drops and heat issues while playing genshin Impact. However, in this video the game runs smoothly with no frame rate drops. Was there an update to improve performance or does the game just run better on the 12 pro max despite having the same specs as the 12?

I been trying to kill my iPhone 12 to test out this new charger I have by looking at videos, games, web browsing, etc. One thing for sure, this battery holds up GREAT. So if someone was wondering about the battery life on the IPhone 12, rest assured, it is good to go!

Hey yall! So Ive had my 12 for a few weeks now, and its a pretty solid device. I know about the yellow issue and the green flicker issue with the screens - but that is not what Im referring to here. My screen is a little more yellow than my X screen - but I do not have the green flicker at all.

[In dark mode (only dark mode), using Apples apps with the black background and the gray bars - the screen flickers purple for a second like its trying to catch up. It happens in settings, the Apple store, iMessages, etc. It gets a little better with my brightness turned the whole way up.](https://imgur.com/gallery/xg7QZ6w)

I know that there can be OLED bleed - but my X does not do this at all, and when I tried to reproduce it on the screen of the display iPhone 12 at Target - it also didnt seem to happen nearly as much.  

Is this normal? Does your screen do this at all in dark mode? I use my phone mostly in dark mode, so it totally sucks - but I dont wanna waste my time going to an Apple store in a pandemic if this is just how these phones are.

I ordered a iPhone 12 mini yesterday and decided to use the courier service for faster shipping. I got the text message today @ 2:07pm saying Get ready for your delivery arriving by 2:36pm, so I tracked the driver all the way to my house and waited at the front door with a $5 tip. I get a text message @ 2:55pm saying it was delivered so I go outside and look for a package and don't find anything but I do see a car parked outside of my house so I just go back inside and wait for him to come to the door and wait and wait and check back outside every once in a while to see if he's still sitting there, after about 40 minutes of him waiting outside my house he leaves. No package anywhere. Called customer service now have to wait 11 days for them to do an investigation and get my replacement or refund.

**TLDR :** Post mate driver waited outside my house for 40 minutes then left without delivering.

I am a bit out of the loop on USB-C and wireless charging and such. With the 12 not coming with a brick, its hard for me to figure out what the best way to charge is.

I have 12 Mini. If I dont care about wireless charging, what wattage USB-C adapter should I be looking for in order to provide the fastest corded charging? 18-20 watt? or is that much only needed for wireless charging?

Hello guys. I think my iphone 12 has a battery problem. I just bought the iphone 12 a week ago and i have a feeling it has a battery problem, but still have the battery maximum capacity to 100%. So i performed an experiment/test and i found out that every 4-5 minutes of use, my iphone drains by 1-2%. And my iphone have screen time of 5-7 hours since the last charge (to 100%) . I usually charge my phone between 15% to 20%. Is this normal or is it a problem? Thank you. Im just worried

I just noticed that the iPhone 12s battery life really  takes a hit when using the phone for long periods (heavy gaming session) otherwise using it in burst, gaming for less than an hour spread throughout the day, seems to make the battery last much longer

1) Be in a darkish room (Nighttime with a subtle mood lamp type of dark)

2) Turn on Night Shift and set it to max warmth

3) Download this app: https://apps.apple.com/in/app/synesthesia-music-visualizer/id1046438840

4) Open the app

5) Allow microphone access

6) Navigate to the Bubbles effect within the app

7) Set phone brightness to about 30-45% and make some random sounds

You will immediately either see some very obvious Green Screen Flickering or perfect pitch blacks as the app renders bubbles onto the screen based on the noises it picks up from the microphone!

Just got the 12 pro max and literally cannot connect to my home wifi. I use the Google wifi pods, and it just constantly says that "I'm not connected to the internet" even though wifi works totally fine on every other device.

  
Seems as though many folks have had the problem (see thread below), but haven't found a fix. I've tried all the obvious things like resetting my network, upgrading the software, and forgetting the network.

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas? Greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I placed my order through Verizon for the 12 PM on the 11th and took the option to trade in my XS Max which, at the time, was in what I would consider very good condition.  Last night I take it out of my pocket and felt something funny scarp my hand and...son of a bitch... the back glass broke.  A circle around the top lens.  I dont want to change my order in any way to avoid delays with my delivery date and based on the questionnaire when you do a trade in it looks like I went from getting about $350 to $20.    

My question is whether anyone knows if this will cause me any issues if I simply dont send them my XS Max?  Dont want to be in breach of any agreement with the trade in offer.

Went to Apple Store and showed the idiots that my screen has a yellow tint. The person at the genius bar compared their phone to mine. My phone had True Tone off and hers had True Tone on and says that my phone looks more cooler than hers. Well obviously because yours has True Tone on. I told her to turn off True Tone on her phone and she goes and tells me that it was set up this way and all phones are calibrated differently, like wtf?

hdr and dolby vision 10 bit 

the video looks awesome on the phone 

but on youtube still saying 1080 p 60 and soooooo bright ? why ?

I saw other people uploaded dolby vision 4k 60fps from the iphone 12 pro max and looks awesome on youtube! 

do i need to wait till youtube finishing the processing of the video ?

Coming from a 7 Plus to a 12, the YouTube official app has been really buggy for me. Returning to the YouTube home page after watching a couple of videos and reloading causes it to load the same and only 4 videos every time. It gets fixed with a reopen but its annoying as hell. Anybody else?

Steps to reproduce:
1. Turn on dark mode (True Tone and night mode could be on or off doesnt matter)
2. Go to a dark room or area (maybe in your room or somewhere at night)
3. Set the brightness of the display to the lowest amount
4. Open the settings app or any app

Everything (besides the pure black background) just looks like it has a bluish tint to it. For example, the individual cells (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.) have a bluish tint in them.

But when you turn the brightness up the bluish tint is gone. Is this normal?!

Just received the iPhone 12, unboxed, charged, and then I updated it. After the update, the touch screen stopped working, I could not swipe up from the white welcome screen but it does register some taps. Also, the phone became EXTREMELY hot and ran out of battery in an hour. I then charged it up and tried to boot it into recovery and it didnt work. Got it into DFU mode to restore the phone, and still didnt work. What happened?

I have an iPhone 12 and a 12 mini.  I have ZOOMED view set on both.  Some of my apps were full screen and others were not (boxed smaller view). 

I thought it was an issue with the apps not updating yet for the 12, but the issue was turning off ZOOMED view.  Those apps (Amazon, Games, etc.) went full screen as soon as I did that.

I don't know if this is a bug or by design, but I don't recall my 11 having this issue.

I pre-ordered my 12 pro max, and unfortunately it's going to take awhile to get here since the nearest apple store is 4 hours away from me. I've been watching so many reviews and over thinking quite a lot. I'm okay with the bigger size but my biggest issue is weight. I don't want my arm sore at the end of the day. To everyone who has the 12 pro max how is the weight? How does it feel at the end of the day or when you're laying down? I'm trying to see if I should just cancel my order and get the 12 pro instead.

Hi, just recently bought an iPhone 12 and I am having some problems with camera at night. I don't think it should look like this (this shitty) in basic camera app, and what is that shift in colors when I entered to view the photo? Then I tried taking a photo with VSCO and it looks much better (still don't know if it should look like this but it's doable).

I tried changing every possible settings in camera app but no luck. What should I do? Anyone having the same problem?

Since Friday I have been using the iPhone 12 mini, and it shocked me that the phone lasts a whole day!!! Just today, I've been using it a lot and it's still at 50%. 50% after a whole day what in the actual f\*\*\*. I seriously don't know what reviewers does to their phone since they said the iPhone mini only just lasts a full day if you are a light user. 

&amp;#x200B;

How are some of your experiences with the iPhone 12 mini?

After upgrading to the new iPhone, I noticed that when I click on a contact within Messages and go to Info, any photos that I have sent to that person are gone. The texts were never erased, so the pics are still in there I just have to scroll through the conversations to find it (which takes forever). Anyone know how to download the rest of these pics?

Topic:
I want the iPhone 12 Pro Max because of the 2.5 x zoom. HOWEVER, I hate the size. Im a portrait photographer and I really love how punched in the 2.5 zoom looks. 

You think doing 2.5 x digital zoom on the normal 12 pro could achieve the same results?

I already had the problem with the yellow screen tint but now Im seeing flickering. Ive seen it on Reddit and I thought it might just be the app but now Ive seen it on the Twitter app and on one other. Mine is a iPhone 12

Example: Last year I got a used 2017 iPad Pro 10.5. As much as a month ago, I'd vigorously check this device for any water droplets (like if my hands were wet prior or I put my water bottle down a bit too hard) and such like a maniac. Didn't really help that iPads aren't IP rated (even though I use an iPad Mini 1 as a music interface in the shower with no problems).

Cue the 12 Pro Max delivery, and now I just don't give as much of a fuck anymore about vigorously checking the iPad like that. Rather all of that has gone to the 12 Pro Max. I check it more intensely than I did my X... Despite being like 6x more water resistant and still in a case (though the speaker holes are exposed of course). Whether I wash my hands (hands could still be a bit wet!), lotion my hands (don't want lotion residue on my phone or potentially clogging my speakers!), etc., I do a fucking phone body check like 3-5 times a day lol.

And yet while I do it, I know it's fucking insanity but I can't stop myself. I'm not sure if it's OCD or what, as I did have a few issues in regards to constantly washing my hands but I've gotten somewhat better with that. I'm hoping writing this out and reading it to myself on just how stupid this is will make me stop lmao.

Also probably doesn't help I paid $1,399 for this phone. 

So, anyone else? Feel free to tell me how outrageous this is, I know it is yet I can't stop.

Recently got the new iPhone 12 pro max and I like to listen to my music loud.I keep getting health app warnings and it automatically lowers my volume which is really irritating. 

I live in the uk is there anyway to stop this? Ive disabled the lower loud volume sounds in settings but it still happens.

Many thanks In advance

I am planning on getting the 12 because I like that its lighter than the 12 pro and I dont really care for the extra cam and other features of the pro. It is offically listed at 164 grams vs 12 pros 188 grams at apples website .. But yesterday I came across an unboxing vid in youtube where the girl have a weighing scale and weighed the 12 and it actually registered at 173 grams which is 9 grams heavier than the listed weight. she also weighed an iphone 8 which showed its real listed weight. Now im really conflicted because if thats the real case it wont be much different in terms of weight from the 12 pro, which is one of the reasons im getting it cause I really want a lighter phone presuming even adding a case and a screen protector on it.. I was just wondering if any of you can confirm, this if you have automatic weighing scale lying around.. Thanks

I've got the new iPhone 12 Pro Max and love it, having upgraded from the XR!

Weird issue though - when I take it off my wireless charger in the morning (third party QI charger), the charging symbol remains in the top-right corner as if it's still charging? It seems to stay there until I reboot the phone.

Has anyone else experienced this? Unsure if it's a bug or an issue with my phone specifically? I'll have to do a backup/restore and see if that solves the issue, and perhaps try a different charger (although seems weird it would be related to the charger itself, especially as it was always fine with my XR!)

Hi, is it real that the normal iPhone 12 drains much much faster than the 11 in 3D applications like games? In some videos the battery lasts 3 hours (while lasting 7.5 on the 11). Can you confirm this?

Just a PSA, I decided to switch cases after a couple of days with my 12 Pro Max from a snug/form fitting polycarbonate case to something else. 

The cut out on the case around the glass camera housing was pretty close to the raised edge. Even though I was careful removing the case, it looks like it snagged the edge of the camera housing/bump where it comes to a point and left marks. 

Bummed that a stupid plastic case meant to protect a phone would damage it, but I wanted to make sure others pay extra attention to the camera bump with polycarbonate cases.

So, this is very spoiled of me BUT I have the opportunity to upgrade my regular iPhone 12 (PRODUCT) Red to either an iPhone 12 Pro or iPhone 12 Pro Max. 

Right now, I feel the size of the 12/12 Pro is perfect. I actually find it small compared to my old iPhone 11. 

I take A LOT of photos and I miss having a Zoom lens (I had the iPhone X and iPhone Xs prior). If I go iPhone 12 Pro Max, itll feel like a new phone because its bigger cause of the size and the night shots looks better(from a photographers perspective), but Im also afraid of the size. Ive never had a Max phone before. 

If I get the iPhone 12 Pro, the size and everything is the same as my iPhone 12 so nothing will feel that different. 

Thoughts from anyone with either?

I love the iPhone 12 pro max, but I dont like the camera bump. It would be the perfect phone if it didnt have a camera.

Do you guys think if I used my dremel to flatten out the camera bump that it would make the whole phone not work or just the camera?

My plan is to grind the bump off then color fill the area with epoxy to have a nice beautiful flat phone

Thx guys!

Hey everyone and thank you for all the reddits posts and your reviews for iphone12 mini/pro/max.

Hey, Im going from the 6S &gt; 12 and Im really looking forward to it Im in desperate need of an upgrade and this phone ticks all my boxes. bar one thing. Im terrified that Ill be a bigger target in the case of robbery.

I originally bought an iPhone 12, but shortly exchanged it for the iPhone 12 Pro; both seem to have a yellowish tint or a warmer than normal display. This isnt too noticeable when holding the phone by itself, but it is when comparing it to my iPad Pro or my wifes iPhone 11. 

Currently I am using the Color Filter hack found in the display options, but I wanted to know from other users experiencing this issue if it got better when looking at the phone from an angle?
When I turn the Color Filter option off, the yellowish tint seems to go away when looking at the display slightly off axis rather than direct head-on.

Is this common across the board or am i alone on this one?

Looking for a nice premium leather case for iPhone 12 pro max. I would prefer that it works with MagSafe and potentially have a finger loop (not popsocket).

So Ive had my regular iPhone 12 for a month on Saturday and heres a few things compared to my xs which now belongs to my wife.

Build 

The size is great, slightly larger than the xs but barley now I dont notice and its much lighter being made from aluminium. I chose the white option so it looks smart and classy and very much like the og squared edge phones which I love.

Screen

The screen quality does like nicer than than the xs but theres not much in it but the larger size screen in a slightly larger, hardly noticeable body size I do really like. 

Speakers 

To my ears the speakers on the xs sound better to me than the 12s. Dont know if the xs being a more premium materials build is why but there it is. They still sound great thought just not as good at full volume to me at least.

Cameras 

The cameras are fantastic, a great upgrade. Portrait mode is improved and seems to be much better around hair etc. The sharpness is fantastic and nightmode which I didnt have before its amazing, cant believe how good in nearly a fully dark room.
Wide angle is good but I think personally I might have preferred a telephoto instead of the wide but the wide is clever how it zooms out. I dont miss a telephoto enough to make me go for the pro though.

Battery life  

This is been a breath of fresh air.
I dont use 5g, Im in the uk so its not that common but for me I dont need it. Im around WiFi a lot but 4g is perfectly good for me so 5g is turned off and my brightness has never moved from 50%

Im getting with testing 8-9 hours screen time when I really push on days off like the below graph. But on a work day I normally have around 3.5-4 hours screen time with around 65% battery left but for me this is a 8-9 hours sot phone with my usage. YouTube, social, eBay, Reddit etc.
So very happy with that. Can use the phone all day without worrying about battery life.
I wirelessly charge over night.

My xs got around 5 maybe 5.5 at a push with 0% left with 100% capacity due to being a replacement. I had a smart battery case on it that took that much higher but its nice to not need one of those thick heavy cases now.

Below is with the phone at 13% left which is never below 35 normally for me but wanted to see how it went on a day off.

Overall the xs was a great phone which the wife now loves after having a 6s. Did I really need to upgrade? Not really but the classic square design, the 3 hours longer battery, awesome cameras and old phone gifting an upgrade for my wife meant it was defiantly worth it for me.

Has anyone else experienced this?  When I keep my iphone and my hotel keycard for my room in the same pocket, the key card gets totally wiped.  It seems like the hotel has to completely toss the old keycard and issue me a new one.  

This has happened 3 times... And the only thing I can think of is the magsafe on the phone.
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-11-17
Howdy everyone. Im in the midst of an internal 12 vs 12 pro debate and looking for some advice. I currently use the 6s. The main thing holding me back from just going with the 12 is the lack of telephoto. The difference in price for the phones is right around $260 (taking into account more expensive AppleCare for the 12 pro). If I got the 12, I could just attach a 58mm lens from Moment for way under that $260 difference. At that point am I just going too far out of my way to save money? Am I putting too much of an emphasis on the telephoto lens, having never even used it before?

I do quite a bit of hiking and camping, so zooming in on animals, trees, and other things is what Im hoping the telephoto would be great for. Planning on using this phone about as long as Ive had this 6s for (hopefully).

Hello everyone.

I just upgraded from an iPhone XR to an iPhone 12. So both devices have the same screen size. I have 2 questions:

The max screen brightness is definitely higher on the XR than the iPhone 12. Is that normal? The screen on the iPhone 12 is also noticebly more yellow-y. Is that normal as well? This is my first iPhone with an OLED display.
But the thing that bothers me way more is this:

The display elements (button, bars, text, etc.) are definitely bigger on the iPhone 12 than on the XR (meaning they're wasting more spac). Examples: Top and bottom bar in Safari an mail app, the Reddit app in Grid view and "Apple" size font setting shows more posts on the XR than on the 12, the buttons in the eBay app are larger, and so on. It seems like the 12 has a "lower virtual resolution". Is this known and I should just get used to it or is there a way to change this? Is it clear what I'm talking about? And no, changing the text size under Settings -&gt; Display -&gt; Font size does not affect the size of the buttons/topbar/etc. in any of the apps mentioned. And yes I already have checked the "zoom" setting and it is set to standard.

Thanks in advance! If anything needs clarification, let me know.

I upgraded to a 12 Pro from an 8 and I have to admit that the camera quality is so lackluster. I dont know if I have a lemon or if Im personally doing something wrong but my 8s photos look the same. As someone who takes a lot of photos, this is really bumming me out..
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-11-17
I am considering buying Pro Max. After watching the reviews, it seems the improvements are largely just Apple Marketing fluff and not much irl.

My question is regarding the tele lens. The extra zoom seem to make a difference only in portraits: = potentially better and organic bokeh because of the slighly longer focal length. But since its a slower f2.2 lens, could that also mean that the portraits from non-max f2.0 lens might have better bokeh and sharper picture because of better light capturing capability?

Have you seen anyone testing this? What are your thoughts?

Hi All,

This would be a first for me, but I am bored with the Android OS and am considering a change. I would be coming from a Pixel 4XL and moving to an iPhone 12 Pro or Pro Max. I have had Android phones since the dawn of time, but am very fluent with iPhone because of work.

Anyone have any thoughts on how these devices line up? Would I be happy with this switch? What should I look out for?

Thanks in advance.

I use an Android currently

5G isn't a big deal for me

Battery is a moderate priority for me

I can live with 2 cameras on the back instead of 3 if it takes better pictures in most scenarios (night time)

Would really appreciate the opinions of folks who have used both of these.

Do you wait till it hits 0%? 
Do you charge when it hits a certain amount?
Do you use a fast charger?
Do you charge all the way to 100%?
Overnight charging?
How many times do you charge in a day?
Do you use a wireless charger/magsafe?
Do you use low power mode?

Right now i would charge my phone whenever it hits 35%, and i stop charging at about 85%. I use the 20w charger. Just curious on knowing how do you guys handle your devices :D

Im blown away by the battery life. Way better than my note 9 ever did. I charged it Sunday at 2am and its currently Tuesday at 2am.  Thats 48h. Over that time I had screen-on time of 7h45m. And I still have 30% remaining as we type, will try to push it tomorrow too to see if i can get 3 days out of it (the first two days were heavy use)

The usage is mainly on WiFi (maybe 1h of LTE in there), varying brightness, location on. Network and WiFi remained on during the night. There was also more screen-off usage for streaming music and TV. 

Just wanted to share for anyone on the fence. Its definitely worth it if you can deal with the size for not having to worry at all even over two days of use
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-11-17
Edit: I want to be clear that I cant find any super reliable sources saying the screen is actually less scratch resistance, and I realize there is a lot out there that makes it seem more scratch resistant if anything. For all I know this was an anomaly and does not represent the overall integrity of the screen. This is just a warning for anybody who assumed, like me, that keys wont scratch your screen. 

Also, this is not just a small superficial scratch its surprisingly deep.

Original post: Had this damn phone (12 pro) less than two weeks and it already has a giant gouge in it from some keys in my pocket  which never even left shallow scratches on my iPhone 7 screen (had that phone for 4 years and the screen is still in great condition, never used a screen protector)...

Well, I read up on it and it turns out that the ceramic screen thats more drop proof is in fact softer and less scratch resistant, albeit more shatter resistant.

Please do yourself a favor a get a screen protector ASAP. Im super bummed and wish I had already done so... dont make the same mistake I made...

I bought a screen protector for the 12 which came in the mail today but Im going to my carrier service tomorrow to activate it. I havent even opened the box to hold my phone. Should I put the screen protector on before turning on the phone or after activation? Ive never used a screen protector on any of my smartphones so Im curious. Since theres no touchID, I should be good to go right? What to do? Also if you have any reasoning please do tell

I saw someone else raise this point that if the defect was in the display itself then changing and adjusting the color tint would have no difference on it. So theoretically exchanging a yellow device for a new one would have no difference. When I discussed this with apple support the guy told me that apple has not yet received enough complaints regarding for them to take action immediately so if you are experiencing this please submit a complaint to Apple so they can fix it.

I noticed that the Pros are being delayed for delivery for almost a month with no in-store pick-up available anywhere. This is for both the 12 Pro and the 12 Pro Max. However, the 12 and 12 mini can be received no later than next week, despite the 12 mini and 12 PM launching on the same day.

Maybe the Pros are being withheld on purpose?

How likely do you think it is for Apple to make a new mini next year but with telephoto either in addition or instead of wide angle lens?

I have an 11 pro now and reallllyy want a smaller phone plus the flat sides but I dont want to give up the telephoto. Though having held a mini Im still so tempted...

Should I hold out another year to see if they upgrade the mini?

Hi guys i just got my iphone 12 pro and i thought it was dual sim but it wasnt and no 5g option on my carrier too. What do you think?

Ive had my phone for a few hours, and after 4 hours of intense screen on time, the battery is still at 36% after arriving with about 83/84% (including set up, indexing, downloading all my apps, photos, music etc). This phone is an absolute tank.

My iPhone X which I found hard to leave has also been used for around 4 hours screen on, but has needed to be charged 3 times to do so! I genuinely cant believe how good it is - I know my X being nearly 3 years old doesnt help but even when it was new the battery life was nowhere near this.

If any iPhone X users are questioning upgrading, I say just do it for the battery alone this thing is a champ. I wouldnt let the current battery concerns get in the way as my AirPod Pros died within the time I was on my phone!

hey, yall. super hyped on my 12 mini, but i hate how my Speck case has curved edges that prevent it from standing up on its side as i watch videos/film stuff. ive seen Rhinoshield has a flat edge design, and i had one of their cases on my 11. anyone know if Rhinoshield or any other cases will let you stand the phone on their side? every case review i see on youtube doesnt mention that factor at all. thanks!!

Im one of those people that still ascribes to the two-year rule even though nowadays people are holding onto their phones for longer than that, and my two years is coming up next month. 

The thing is, I *know* my phone is perfectly fine and Id upgrade to the 12 mini for the smaller form factor...but I cant get over the fact that Apple kept the notch *again* (yes, Im one of THOSE people lol) and even though theyll probably shrink it on the iPhone 13, itll still be there anyway. 

I guess what Im trying to say is: How long is TOO long to wait for an upgrade?

Hi all, 

Just got the 12 Mini and everything is sound. Just curious if anyone noticed washed out looking colours?   


Coming from a 6s for reference. I know from android OLEDs, they can have various appearances based on settings, but on the 12 mini, except for the natural white mode, I can't see many options? 

Has anyone else noticed this?

I never understood this fully.

What way is the best way for me to make sure I have everything on my new phone?

Apps, Contacts, Email, etc? I understand that I'll need to enter usernames and passwords again.

What is the best method to migrate all my info?

Any tips will be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance!

I picked up the iPhone pro Max Friday. I preordered it nov 6. On Nov 9 the money got taken out but didnt show up for apple store but the money was gone. Well Saturday I checked my balance and suddenly the money was still there its not showing up that Apple took the money. 

So Im wondering how long it takes for them to take the money out?

I love the look of the new iphones, especially the blue on the 12 pro. I want to enjoy the color while keeping the phone safe from scratches. I am looking for an ultra-thin/clear case which I can pair with a thin screen protector to keep my phone safe while basically looking naked. I am thinking of something like the two linked below, however, I have heard negative things about them.

# This problem happens a lot. Test conditions: middle brightness (40%~80%), better in a dark room

When the iPhone displays a whole black pic (open in iPhone Photos). After the bottom bar disappears, the screen shows green.

When the iPhone displays a whole black video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXHcRiSK\_ys&amp;t=449s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXHcRiSK_ys&amp;t=449s)) After the video buttons are hidden, The screen shows shining green.

iPhone 12 use OLED which should display nothing when showing pure black.

Talk to me about magnetic mounting for the iPhone 12! 

I have a magnetic phone mount that I love, custom mounted on my dash. The mount itself has 4 strong magnets and sticks to anything metallic extremely well. Ive been using a Dockem case with built in metal plate on my XS Max. https://www.amazon.com/dpB079834YY1ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_fabc_ReOSFb1A5D6Q0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1

The iPhone 12 actually does stick to the magnets on the existing mount, right out of the box, but not strongly enough, and keeps slipping off. 

Now I could just get a metallic case for iPhone 12 but that would mean not taking advantage of the MagSafe feature (or having to pull off the magnetic case to charge with MagSafe - which of course defeats the purpose of easy use). 

I thought I could just stick a round metal piece the same size as the iPhone magnet array to my magnetic mount, and then stick my phone to the metal plate. 

When I tried this, however, it still didnt make a strong magnetic hold.

What gives? Are the magnets in the iPhone 12 even strong enough to use for mounting purposes? Anyone try the Belkin mount, which seems to be the only option for magnetic mounting  right now?

Hello.....

I'm asking about the battery performance on the iPhone 12 pro..... 

if you're using wifi only and just using your phone for social media apps Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, youtube, Whatsapp ( NO heavy GAMES) ... with dark mode on 24/7 .... 

how will the battery be? ... how much screen time ? will it stay with me if I woke up at 9:00 am will it stay until 1 am?
 ( I don't think so xD ) 

please give me a clear answer because I'm thinking of buying it if the battery is good enough.....

 I searched for battery test on Youtube and all of them play heavy games for one hour and for some reason it consumes the battery too much from what I was thinking

 (because I thought the A14 is power efficient)

Hey Community,

after 30 hours of usage i realize that the steel scratches very easy!   
I made few tests without and with case. Result is a few of micro scratches on spots like the charger, or the mute switch. Also the dust gets inside the apple cases on the sides of the phone. This will result "blank" spots as on the iphone 4. So you will need to clean the case frequently.

So the question is, is there any polisher paste/set which can remove the micro scratches?  
I did test one which i used for the iphone x,xs,11. This polisher is to "hard" for t this steel.   
Any advice which product i could use for the new iphone 12?

&amp;#x200B;

thanks

As pretty much everybody, I was nervous about how the blue will look in person after seeing all the photos.

However, today I got my iPhone 12 mini and I love the blue. It actually looks just like the blue on the Apple website.

I also got the original silicone case in blue with it and again, I was worried that there would be a big difference between the two colors and it wouldnt look good together. I was wrong. They go great together. The color difference is small, but actually just the right amount to look good. Now Im thinking that if they were the exact same color it wouldnt look as good.

So no need to worry, guys :)

I've read that the shutter speed is still only up to 1 second long. Besides the increased ISO, how does the phone do these amazing night shots? Some of them say they are being taken over a span of 30 seconds (max). I thought that was the length of the shutter speed, but maybe the phone just takes multiple pictures during the 30 seconds and combines them? Just wondering if the 12 Pro Max is able to take slower shutter pictures (i.e. flowing water shots that look like flowing smoke) or if it's all in the software?

Whenever I just recorded a Dolby Vision HDR clip, I always take a look of it in the Photos app before exporting it into my computer. 

What I noticed most of the time, it became this some sort of overly-contrasty and the shadow level are raised which doesnt look HDR in the slightest. Restarting and shutting down the phone (12 Pro Max) helped for a while but it reverts again to that contrasty video that I had issues with.

Does anyone have the same issue with HDR viewing so far?

I was hyped for iPhone 12 mini because I missed the small form factor of earlier smartphones the (the 2013 Moto X comes to mind).  It's easier to hold with one hand and doesn't feel like a brick in your pocket.

But to be honest, I'm not sure I will keep this phone.  For one, my vision is not as sharp, and I had forgotten how small stuff is to try and read.  You can increase the font size in the Settings, but it doesn't change how big Safari renders text on web pages. 

It also makes me less likely to want to use the phone when I'm at home.  While I'd spend hours on my iPhone 8 plus on my couch, I don't do that with the 12 mini. I'd rather switch to my laptop or tablet than use such a tiny screen.  So I'm usually not near the phone when a call comes in.

If I really wanted a small device for just calling and texting, I could just buy a cheap flip phone and not spend $729.  

Does anyone else regret their mini purchase?  I feel like I will go back to using my 8+ again.

So. My 12 mini is pretty nice, but obviously the battery is smaller than Im used to from my old 11. 

Had this since Friday afternoon. All restoring, updates, set up completed and full new iCloud backup has been made, all appears to be settled. 

Today was the perfect day to test things, as I was going on a day trip to visit family about 120 miles away. Forgive the verbose descriptions that follow, but I figured some context for what was being done with the phone would be useful. 

Took phone off the charger at 7:05 this morning, checked mail and such, had breakfast, got on the road by 8 am. During the car trip, the mini was continuously providing Bluetooth audio via the Podcasts or Music apps, plus some light voice-controlled texting via my AW and Siri. (I know, Im a rebel. But I was on the interstate the whole way and traffic was minimal.) Also did a few Speedtest runs, which provided some decent results. 

Visited my grandma (wifi present for the first time in 2.5 hours of driving) and took some pictures, sharing them with other family members via FB and iMessage. 

Left to have dinner with parents at a place with ZERO cell reception and no wifi, but decided to leave airplane mode off to see how the battery would be impacted as a whole while searching.  

Then went to parents place (wifi present again) and helped out with some stuff, did some searching and texting, some light network stuff, etc. At 3:24 pm I was at 55% battery. 

Got back in car, drove back home while also still using the phone for podcasts and tunes, along with a couple of phone calls.

At 6:14 pm (just walked in the door of my abode) I am now at 35% battery. 

So. While these numbers arent AMAZING, neither are they a disaster. I had ample opportunity to charge if I needed to (car charger, parents place) and I kept my phone off of them purely as a test. Normally I would avail myself of them even on my 11. 

Would my 11 or a regular 12 be better for long-term use, especially without wifi? Absolutely. Am I bothered? Not at all. Honestly, it feels like when I had my XS. The battery on that was...less than impressive, but at least theres a *reason* for that now, since its a mini!

Attached is a pic of how my battery went as the day progressed. Ill be happy to field any questions if anyone has any!

When setting my shiny new iPhone 12 Pro Max, I chose to transfer data from my old iPhone and was then prompted to update new phone to iOS 14.2. After the update was downloaded and prepared, the set up hung with the word install now for an hour with a spinning ball. In the end I had to erase the phone again sms set it up as a new device and do the update manually from their before transferring. Did anyone else, it looks like some folks on Mac Rumors forums experienced the same thing. Posting it here to raise awareness so Apple will address.

Anyone else having this issue?

I've been on the fence between a Mini and a regular 12, and I just can't seem to be able to decide. I'm on a 6 (!) and am really looking forward to the upgrade, and I went checked both out at the store. I've never liked very big phones, the 6's size is pretty sweet IMO. The mini was just amazing to hold, but I could probably get used to the 12 if I had to.

I'm concerned about the battery on the mini, mainly because I kinda don't know how my own usage will be like. With the 6, the battery (at 92% health) and the performance are now so poor that my average usage a day is \~2.5 hours because I try to avoid using it as much as I can. When it was still good, I remember gaming a little, not the intensive huge games though. I don't watch videos pretty much ever, but I browse and just scroll around the internet quite a lot, whatsapp, email etc, the usual stuff (the 6 can't even handle email anymore). Even more confusing is that pretty much every battery comparison seems to put the mini at just around an hour lesser than the 12, which doesn't seem like all that much. Aaghh, I'm so confused.

TL;DR: My old phone is so old and slow that I don't know how much I'll use my new one, and so I can't decide if the mini will last me fine or not. Help me decide, please! (Also, where I live returns aren't entertained like they are in most places, so I can't try one out and return it if I don't like it).

Very bland but never had any issues with it, but they don't seem to have them anymore.

I just took out my phone from the case and discovered a nick in the frame. I put the phone in the silicon Apple case when I unpacked the phone in the store, and I have never dropped the phone or anything that could cause this nick. 
16 days have gone now and I would never see this dent if I didnt take off the case.

Do I need to do something when switching between G5 and G4? Switching to G5 immediately gets my phone onto the fast lane. Switching back not though. The indicator at the top of the screen says I'm back at 4G, but I still have the fast speed. Tried plane mode and switching off the phone signal for a short moment - still fast. The only thing that seems to work is switching the phone off and on. Am I doing something wrong or is something wrong with my phone?

Tldr -  unless youre gaming or a really heavy user, I think youll be fine. 

iPhone Mini delivered on Friday. Spent Friday night messing about with it on and off charger. Initial reaction was that it was nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be but no stats to back it up. 

Saturday I was planning on stress testing it but ended up going for a walk to test the cameras so wanted to be at 100% when I left the house. 

Sunday however I thought Id see what a real world use would be like without topping up throughout the day. 

So Sunday, off charge at 6am, lots of social media, Spotify both listening to through the phone speakers and downloading loads of playlists, general new-phone-fannying-about, setting up Waze, connections to my car Bluetooth etc. 10 hours later Ive just hit 25%. Screen-on time is considerably better than the Samsung Galaxy S10 Ive moved from. 

Really happy with that, in my working day I will have the option to top up in my car on the way to and from work so I have no doubts at all that this lil thing will get me through the average day without a problem at all.

Edited to say that there are 2 screenshots there, the second shows this [graph](https://imgur.com/a/sKWNXmU), the screen on time is including the whole graph, ie before charging. Im not claiming 10 hours sot on the mini. 

Looks like Ill end up with over 5 hours though which is plenty for my normal usage.

Update after working out how to show the full day [graph](https://imgur.com/a/j3TDC4D): 15% battery now. Off charge for 12 hours. Just short of 6 and a half hours screen on time. 

Thank you to /u/ndrchr for explaining how to get the full day graph.

Ive been looking for posts to get me excited about getting the 12 but alI i seem to see are posts about minis and pro MAXs. I ordered a 12 because it felt pretty nice in the hand, a bit longer battery and the bigger screen is a luxury for using as a sat nav and movies. I travel a lot so the battery life is fairly important. I was torn between the standard and the mini but ill get my 12 in 10 days.
If you prefer the 12 standard, what do you like more about it?

I have the larger screen iPhone 8. I do not upgrade very often. considering the price, I am not sure I want to upgrade if its just a little faster and takes clearer pictures. Are there things it fundamentally does differently? I remember being impressed when I first got my iPhone 8, upgrading from 4s or 5 I think

Iphone 12 Pro Max- Impressions after 48 Hours from a Long Term Android User

Been 48 hours I have been using this phone. Long time Android user(More than 11 years, been using Androids from gingerbread). So this review will contain aspects of the phone as well as iOS in general. I got the Pacific Blue version of the phone.

Build quality - Its insane how this phone looks and feels in the hand. My wife uses an iPhone 11, and I use it from time to time. Its very different from how the 11 feels. Its very boxy and secure in the hand, something which can be used without a case if one was up to it. It also has heft and character and may be a bit cumbersome for someone having smaller hands. I have been using large phones all my life and love the size of this phone. Love that this doesnt have the curved edges of the Samsungs making it more practical to use. The back glass feels very premium and has a texture of brushed metal. The edges are polished and very shiny and provides a good contrast to the brushed back making it really stand out. 

Cameras - The main wide sensor is bigger than the last years models and it actually translates to better performance. The ultra-wide camera system is the same as the last generation and its a very good camera for day light shots. Night mode for the ultra-wide which is introduced in the Iphone 12 phones works pretty well for most scenarios but not as good as the main sensor. The focus is fixed at infinity on this camera which doesnt matter for landscape shots which you will be using this camera for mainly. The main camera is insanely good. In particular I liked the neutral tones in the photos which is very different from what I got from Samsung which seem to create more punchier unreal photos, but I like the Iphones photos more because it works very hard to keep the scenes true to life. The main camera has a shallower depth of field compared to last years models which is prominent on macro shots and close ups. The 2.5x zoom on the telephoto camera is amazing for portraits. I prefer it quite more than the 2x zoom on the regular pro model, as it zoom in more to the subject and provides really good portrait shots even without the portrait mode. Night mode shots on the main camera is amazing and Lidar really helps in focusing in pitch dark conditions. Video on the main sensor is excellent, image stabilisation is even better than my go pro 7 if not better. The In Body Image stabilisation does make a difference if you are running or walking briskly. The selfie camera is excellent as well, both for video calls and taking selfies of group-selfies. All in all the camera system is incredibly reliable and can handle anything you throw at it with ease. 

Performance and battery- The performance has been amazing, coming from a 3 year old android phone(Galaxy S8+) it was a huge leap in real world performance. There is zero lag at anything I threw at it. I didnt have to close apps running in the background, didnt have to worry about anything. Games, apps everything was very smooth with zero signs of slowing down. Battery life has also been excellent, with a single charge lasting easily more than a day. Charging with the 20W brick is fast and can get you upto 50 percent in half an hour and when you switch on Optimised battery it will wait after it has charged past 80% based on your usage. This is supposed to have an impact on long term battery health. The sound from the speakers sound amazing and better than anything I have heard before and even louder than my wifes iPhone 11.

The good, the bad and the ugly(vs. Androids) -

The Good - The user experience is amazing. I now know why people who has experienced using an Iphone cant go back to Androids easily. Its smooth, intuitive and not flashy. I tried using my android after using this phone after a day and had a hard time using  it.
Love the control centre. Love that it is in the right hand corner of the screen making it easy to reach one handed for right handers. 
Love the subtle animations. Love the haptic feedback. I heard of haptic feedback before but unless you use it its very difficult to realise how good and well refined it is unless you experience it first hand. 
Really like the keyboard and how comfortable it is to type on- I typed this whole message on my Iphone keyboard. 
Love the fact that you can uninstall any of the pre-installed apps, also love the fact it doesnt come with much bloatware. 
But the thing I love the most about it is there is a difference in the quality of apps between iOS and Android and in almost all cases the iOS apps are better. 
The other thing I like is the attention to security, you can explicitly give instagram and facebook permissions to certain photos only, which I found is awesome, I dont want them to have access to my whole album. It also asks explicitly for location permissions for apps which is trying to access my location. iOS also doesnt allow apps to open up their own browser sessions but rather redirects to safari which I found amazing from a security standpoint. FaceId is amazing, and you forget that if even exists, unless of course you are wearing a mask.
The widgets on iOS are amazing and of a higher quality than android, I found them to refresh really well.

The Bad- Apps which are free on android are paid on iOS, actually this may not be such a bad thing as they generally would have less ads. 
Notification management on android was better, please do let me know in the comments it there is a way to manage notifications in a better way.
Picture in picture for youtube is missing - I must confess I am a heavy youtube user and do miss having this feature on iOS

The Ugly- Absence of the fingerprint scanner really bothers me, specially when I am out and wearing a mask, putting the passcode everywhere is a real hassle. Really disappointed that apple didnt put one in this year considering the times we are living in.

tl;dr: Iphone 12 pro max and iOS are amazing and you need to feel it to believe it how good this phone is.


Any other android users switched over to iOS using the Iphone 12 lineup, what are your thoughts?

Isnt the magnet on the back contributing to the weight?
Also whyd one charge using MagSafe when the wired charging is a better option?
It also costs a lot to buy MagSafe accessories, when they arent even reliable.

It is a huge marketing gimmick.
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-11-14
If anyone else is obsessed with the case animation for each color case, all you have to do is hold up the back of the case to the back of the phone and line up the magnet, even if it already has another MagSafe case on it. Enjoy!

Hi peeps, I am looking to buy Apple Care but I could do with some advice from experienced people who have used Apple Care in the past, when I have researched it, it seems kinda vague.  I just want to know 3 things...

1) What is the turn around on a broken screen when it is cracked (I believe apple send one out then you send your broken back afterwards but I'm not 100% sure)

2) If it is a case of them sending you a phone and you returning your faulty one do they require money upfront incase you don't return your faulty one, much like Microsoft do with xBox's and Surfaces

3) Is it only a 2 years service? I'm thinking of going monthly and would ideally like it to last the life span of the phone

Thank you in advance guy, I did look round Reddit first but couldn't find definite answers

I dont know if I'm too hard on my phone but I feel like 7/8 hours of SOT is bad, I am only on 4G for a few hours, rest on WiFi. I mostly use Reddit, Twitter and YouTube. Is 7/8h SOR average or is it actually good or bad? I just dont have a real reference for my judgement.

How do you find the drop protection to be? I am considering the apple case mainly because of its microfibre on the inside that apparently should protect the device's shiny frame ..Apparently the leather case doesn't have the microfibre lining on the sides, and the silicone one does.. 

Also, I am undecided between the apple case and the Mous case with the main factors that I take into consideration being the drop and scratch protection (apple case definitely looks more elegant and think though)

Recently I got my iPhone 12 pro and theres 39 days left for me to add AppleCare+. Upon going through the process it asks me to tick the declaration box where it says that I must be a resident of the UK and that Im 18 or over. If I took it out now - at age 17, does this mean my cover is void, or can I pretend Im 18 without risk of them asking for my ID at any point in time?

Why does Apple do this? Ive had this on preorder for a week already, and Apple PUSHED BACK my delivery date by a week already. Why not ship them to those who ordered first? Canceled my order and just going to go pick it up now. Pretty pissed about this, though. Thought Apple would be better than this.

Iphone 12 Mini battery life ?

Hi everyone. Im in deep questioning about what phone to get and want to know what people who got their 12 mini think of its battery life. Ive got an 8 with 81% and hate bigger phones. If you could share your experience that would be cool for those like me !

Let me preface this by saying I *love* the phone. It's gorgeous. I love the size (not a problem for me since I came from a plus model), the screen is beautiful, I love the gestures and widgets. But this thing is HEAVY. It is like holding a brick with a screen. If you dropped this on the floor, you'd have to check the floor to see if you made a dent.

I have just upgraded from iPhone 7 to iPhone 12 Pro Max. 

With the iPhone 7 I could press the lightning bolt icon in the upper left corner when in the camera app and had the options on, off or auto. When turned 'on', the flashlight was constantly on before the video even started.

With the iPhone 12 Pro Max the lightning bolt icon is still there but only seems to offer off or auto. 

Am I missing something?

Hi guys and girls ! I just ordered my 12 Pro and I was wondering if it would affect the battery life in the long if I were to use a charger with more than 18W. I'm split between ordering an Anker or an Aukey charger. I'm based in Romania, where 18W chargers aren't that available and I don't really want to wait for an amazon shipment to arrive. I'm open to suggestions.

Got my iPhone 12 pro with the Belkin glass protector. Thing is it just covers the screen and not the bezels. Sufficient maybe but I dont like the look. 

I would like a matte one, not glass, can be a foil. Does anyone know of such a thing?

If you are iphone 5,6,7 user who love small form factors phone and looking for a sign to pull trigger on Iphone 12 Mini - Dont think go for it.

I have been using iphone 7 for 3years and  never loved big size phones but this beats all of other iphone when it comes to comfort. Size is perfect. Lightweight and fits easily in my pocket. Camera quality is  i just got it yesterday so havent been able to test Battery but I dont think its going to be problem if youre a using your phone for browsing social media sites/mail/call. Plus with 20W charger but it fron apple cause iphone mini will charge at 12W so i wouldnt recommend third party 20W chargers.



Have a nice day everyone!

Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

So Ive received my Iphone 12 pro max. I love everything about it except for the screen that has a warm/yellowish tint :/. My previous phone is a s9+ and white is REALLY white, like on whatsapp etc. Ive turned True Tone off which made a difference, because before I thought blue filter was on. But its still too yellow for my liking. Anyone else have the same problem?

&amp;#x200B;

And any ideas on how to get it more neutral/cool?
-------------------------------

Hi all,

So I grabbed an iPhone 12 Pro Max yesterday and am generally impressed, but I'm trying to figure out exactly what the camera is doing to the image data it captures. There is a "Smart Scene" setting (which I can find literally nothing about by Googling it) -- what the heck does this do, exactly? I don't mean "it enhances your photos." I mean, is it doing something like the AutoCorrect feature in iOS Photos, where it messes with the Highlights/Shadows/Color Balance/&amp;c? Presumably something more and "deeper"?

And even with Smart Scene off, it feels like a lot more automatic post-processing is going on in these images than in the 10 XS Max I had most recently, not all of which I like and definitely not in every case. 

Are we stuck with third-party apps to get anything like a "raw" image out of this camera? Am I right that there is so much more post-processing going on in this generation of phones? 

Thanks in advance for any thoughts!

Yours,

Thomas

Hey! Currently typing from my iPhone XR right now! Ive been interested in the 12 for a while now, but i owned an 11 pro for a bit and HATED the beauty-gate on the front camera. Does the 12 have this? Can someone comment some example shots if youre comfortable enough to?

Its horrible. 
Its deep
I can feel it with my fingernail
Its in the middle of the screen. 

Can I exchange it at apple? I ordered on the apple app thru att upgrade. 

How it happened? My dumb ass put it face down on the car hood and a grain of sand was there. I literally heard the scratch happen. Im a idiot I know.

Hello, I just received my Mini and love it so far. I did notice however, that there was a quite noticeable blue shift of the display on lighter images starting at around 30% viewing angle. This is my first OLED and I know that there is some variance but I would be interested to hear from others on this.

A friend says his phone does the same, but I haven't yet been able to compare them directly.

I preorder and bought my iPhone 12 pro the day it came out. I went to Florida the week it came out, so I picked it up there (I live in Maryland). I HAD to get a new phone because my old iPhone 7 went from 100% to 70% in 10 minutes. I couldnt wait even tho I wanted the iPhone 12 pro max. Obviously, its past the 14 day refund period, but I want the iPhone 12 pro max because the 12 pro is too small for me. 

Is there any way for me to return my iPhone 12 pro for the iPhone 12 pro max. (I will pay for the price difference) 
Also, I left the box that my phone came with in Florida but I still have the power cord.

I got my 12 Pro Max today, and it is a big boy! Still deciding whether or not to swap it out for the 12 Pro, but I was wondering if anyone else is getting worse cell performance on the new phones/modem? Im currently on AT&amp;T. I would always get around 1-2 bars of service at home so that seems similar. But getting DL/UL speeds on LTE around 3-5 times less than what I was getting with the 11 Pro.

Not getting the No Service issue or anything. Im supposedly in a 5G area with LTE sprinkled around my area on AT&amp;Ts map (I know that cant be fully trusted). It rarely switches over to 5G even when 5G On is enabled. But Im wondering if this is how its going to be or if I should try another SIM card or something else?

Got the Graphite and the phone is stunning but itd be a bummer if this is how itll be considering I was hyped for the Qualcomm modem over the Intel. Wondering how everyone else is doing.

Just got the 12 mini and love it so far. I got the official leather case and noticed this year has a raised edge on the bottom where you swipe up. 

Because the screen is small, I end up scraping the case every time I try to unlock the phone. If I try to avoid it I end up missing the swipe area completely.

Can anyone recommend a good case that doesn't raise the edge on the bottom swipe?

Hey guys, just curious if anyone has noticed passcode lag where, if Face ID fails because your wearing a mask or something the keys lag, dont even respond, or even take away numbers youve put in.

Hi, everyone, 

I cannot explain the sheer existential crisis (???) I'm having over choosing a Watch (series 6) and iPhone 12 color combo. I'm super antsy about non-matching devices, and I *usually* play it safe with black or white phones, but it bugs me to *no* end that there is no black aluminum watch color (unless I shell out the big bucks for the expensive black one), and I can't stand silver anything. But, I'm also so tired of black and white-- I want to be funky fresh and cool like all of you with one of the nifty new colors! 

Honestly, I friggin' love the blue, but I *cannot* see myself sporting a blue watch on the regular. I could probably be convinced, though. Maybe.

Please send help. Any color combos looking particularly good? Would love to see pics of your watch + iPhone combos to help make my mind up!

(Sorry if this is a dumb waste of a post or if it's been posted a billion times... I'm new here and coming from all Samsung everything!)

I just got a brand new Mini coming from a 6S.

Im now wanting to take full advantage of my new phone as Im sure many of you are!

I was looking around for posts that have a collection of the best apps for iPhone XS and above which take advantage of all the new hardware and processing power... but I found nothing of the sort.

So Ive decided to be the one to create very that post. This is that post.

It would be awesome if you guys could share some of the best apps according you that take advantage of any of the following:

-	The excellent cameras
-	The awesome new display technology
-	The immense processing power

Like whats the best 360 panorama app? The best manual control camera app? The most interesting/good-looking game? Whats an app that does something really quirky and fun? Etc etc.

I purchased my iPhone 12 Pro Max directly from the Apple Store and had it ship to my house. When I bought the phone through the Apple Store app, I chose to "activate later" at checkout because I was anxious to get the order finalized.

Now I have my phone ... and I am really struggling to figure out how to activate it. Originally I thought I would swap in my old SIM card, but I noticed my new SIM card seems designed for 5G. So I figured that wouldn't be ideal and logged into myVerizon account. I can chose to go through the  upgrade process that asks me to put in the IMEI and SIM ID for my new phone ... but the page either spins and does nothing or errors out. I've tried on my laptop, and using the Verizon app on my new phone.

Not sure if I'm doing something wrong or their system is just crashing... Anyone else go through the same process and have any advice?

I got my pro max a few hours ago and I'm in love with it. I love the size, the screen, the look of it and everything. I put on a screen protector but no case. So far, I really love using it without the case (I bought AppleCare+). Don't get me wrong, I have some just in case but so far I love the feel without it. I may keep it that way.

So basically I found a buyer for my 8 that I never really liked. Well, one? It was easy to sell. Guess it also helped that I've never used the earpods. Got a good cashback deal, and now I'm pround owner of a 12 Mini. I'm really happy with the size and weight! The screen is something to get used to. The colour is a bit warmer unless you turn it sideways, and then it looks a bit green-ish. Haven't figured out yet how to fully close down apps instead of just minimizing them. Will take some time to get used to the lack of a home button I think. And any idea what low data mode is? 

In hindsight I maybe should have chosen a different colour than black. It might be difficult to find on dark background without a silver edge. On the other hand, I only like black and red, and red was a bit too visible for my taste. So, perfect colour. 

This is probably the first time that I actually bought any piece of tech on release. I'm usually a few years behind.

Hey guys,

So I pulled this bad boy out of the box today and went straight into messing around with it. One of the first things I noticed, unfortunately, is a weird focus "glitching" in the video when switching between 1X and 2.5X in the iOS camera app. 

[HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uf3mii50vkf3cun/IMG_0026.MOV?dl=0) is one example. No idea why it wouldn't be able to actually just keep focus in the 2.5X from the 1X. Ruins the shot completely. 

Anyone else experiencing weird issues with focusing? Just trying to figure out if it's my device or what.

Thanks!

Hi. I recently purchased an iPhone 12 Pro. During startup, it basically forces me to update to the latest ios. However, once the update is downloaded and prepared, it shows the install button with a spinning gear next to it. Please let me know if anyone else if having these issues and how you/they resolved it.

I'm planning to buy the 12 and I've never had an iPhone before.
What charger do you recommend for me and is it good to use the fast charger or use the slow (I read somewhere it's better for the battery to charge slow)?
I usually charge overnight and rarely during the day.
Thanks for your help.

And anyway do other wireless chargers good with the phone  or what do you use else than apple wireless chargers?

(I have the 12 Pro but I still check by habit)

I saw last night a couple of stores around me in the LA area had just one iPhone 12 PM or mini available. Then I checked first thing when I woke up and saw that almost every store near me had availability for most of the iPhone 12 PM or mini options available for pick up today or tomorrow.

Thats how I ended up getting my 12 Pro. I checked on release day and found some available for pick up next day. And the following days when there would be none available by the afternoon, when Id check first thing the next morning there would be iPhones in stock for pick-up!

So those who have a late delivery time, wouldnt hurt to check the online store first thing in the morning :)

Im sure people have noticed the very warm temperature color on the iPhone 12 displays. Is there any suggestions/ has anyone heard for apple addressing this?

Hello, I just received my Mini and love it so far. I did notive however, that there was a quite noticeable blue shift of the display on lighter images starting at around 30% viewing angle.

I really like photography and taking photos and stuff but realistically I cant be carrying around a big camera all day and realistically even when Im out and stuff with friends for dinner or something it would be very hard to pull out a camera if you know what I mean. With that being said is an iPhone 12 pro max good at what it does, in taking detailed photos, and nice photos thatll likely be for sending to friends (not really professional editing) but would it have the possibility and ceiling to go beyond casual into taking solid photography shots if needed as well?

Thanks so much :)

This is my third iPhone 12 pro. First had a defect on the antenna band. Second had a screen defect. Now this one I picked up today also has a screen defect (like a small dot on bottom left of screen). At first I was really adamant on getting a perfect phone as the price was quite hefty. But at this point Im just exhausted of going to the Apple store and booking appointments. I dont know if its just me noticing small little things like these or the phones are actually not made as great this year. I tend to look at the screen under bright light whilst putting on a screen protector and noticed. 

Is it even worth taking this back for a fourth time?

I have the new iPhone12 with 256gb. 
All of my photos and videos are go directly to the iCloud for saving memory.  As a result, the phone has only used about 20 gb of 256 storage.

If I add about 60 GM worth of music, will it slow down my phone excessively?

As the title. I just got this phone, and I noticed that the iPhone 12 side button was mushy and seemingly less pronounced when compared to the volume buttons. It didnt have same click to it. I normally wouldnt mind, but when I put the silicone case on it, it took a great amount of force to turn the phone on or off. Is this an actual defect or just the way it is? I know that no phone will be perfect, so I dont wanna go to the Apple store and waste their time with my nit-picking if theyre all manufactured this way. Thanks!

Hi,

I see all sorts of people talking about going out with just a card and id with their iphones. They claim with that and apple pay they can function. What do you do if you have cash? I deal with some at work and usually have a bit in my pocket. Is there some sort of debit where you can deposit locally and conveniently but isn't a bank? I have my wallet coming before the weekend and would love to try to minimize what I carry around. 

Thanks

Got my first iPhone 12 Pro on October 23. Came with yellowy green tinted screen. Took it back and got a replacement. Replacement had better screen but not perfect but manageable, until today it goes back to the horrible yellowy green tint seen on my first iPhone 12 Pro. I cannot even take it back to Apple Store because everything is closed again in UK. iPhone 12 Pro has been the worst device I have ever owned. This is getting ridiculous now.

Should I get the iPhone 12 with 4GB of ram or 6? 12 or pro?
Thing is that pro is heavier so Im not sure. Im not sure if I need extra ram to multitask though? Is 4GB enough or no?
I often multitask sometimes with heavy usage apps. Im not sure if 4 GB is enough. How much ram does it use before much of any apps are open so to drive the phone itself? How much ram is leftover for apps? How much do I need.
Say I might have a game open, the camera, notes, mail, YouTube, calendar open at once. Is 4GB enough for all that or a little more? Or do I need 6? 
Im just not sure I want the extra weight...
So hard to decide! Help

I've had my iPhone 12 Pro for about 2 weeks now and I've noticed that after the first day or two, my camera takes well over 3-4 minutes to focus which is super frustrating. Sometimes it just won't focus at all. I've just completely stopped taking pictures at all because it annoys me so much.

I upgraded from an iPhone 7 and never had this problem with my old phone. I assumed that the focus would be better and faster when I upgraded, especially with the lidar. 

I've tried multiple things like adjusting the angle, distance, lighting, etc. but my camera just takes unbelievably long to focus.

I just got my baltic blue leather case for my iphone 12 pro and tbh im just a little disappointed. 

my last phone, the iphone 7, i had the leather case and i loved it, I used it ever since the iphone 7 release. i just upgraded to the 12 pro and wanted to get the same leather case because i loved my old one so much, however, on the new case it doesnt really hug the phone. if i feel the inside rim theres a very subtle bump, yet i was expecting the case to hug the phone just like the previous leather case, kinda like covering up the bezels very slightly instead of just being next to the phone. does anyone else understand what i mean? its not a deal breaker im sure ill still keep the case but i was just surprised seeing it like this. 

also when i put my phone in my case, i dont get that cool animation everyone talks about :(

Hear me out. 

There are a few things I don't like with the 8. One thing is the size of it as I have small hands. The 12 mini would be an advantage. The new camera sounds tempting. However,

* do I need to use faceID to log in? Outside I nearly constantly wear sunglasses (odd eyes), plus now facemasks, and something to protect my ears in the colder seasons. I doubt this will work. 

* so how does the battery of a new 8 compare to a new 12, both when resting over night and when in use? I read some rather devastating reviews, but no actual comparison.

-------------------------------
1 : 2020-11-11
So  I've been trying to find reviews of this case, specifically with how  well it works with MagSafe, but I can't really find anything. I usually  use the defender with my phones (since I have a tendency to drop my  phone, work and all that) but this year I got the official silicone case  with Magsafe, since I figure that'll probably have the best  compatibility.

Does  anyone have any experience with the Otterbox Symmetry+ cases with  MagSafe? Does it still stick onto MagSafe accessories and charge at the  full 15w like the official Apple cases do? Or does it just work with the  charging puck but doesn't get the full speed since it's thicker and the  magnets don't seem embedded into the case (looks like they're on some  kind of cardboard insert?)

Hi all. i've been stewing about this for a while now, but today's the day I bite the bullet and get either the 12 white or 12 pro silver. I think the 12 looks great, but the pro is so tempting too and I don't want to regret not getting the best at that size (not interested in the max). I keep thinking about the weight and comfort in hand though.

Are there any 12 pro users out there that wish they would have gotten the 12 because the pro is uncomfortable? or do you get used to it quickly?

Any 12 users with 12 pro envy?

Any final thoughts before I make the big purchase are appreciated.

Thanks!!

Purchased a new iPhone, its been 2 days and charged it 3 times so far, heavy use streaming shows/movies, YouTube, heavy social media use, first charge was normal and so was the second one, just charged the phone right now and the phone was really hot, so hot that I could feel the heat through the silicone case, took the silicone case off and the phone was really hot, its been 10-15 minutes and the back of the phone still feels warm. What should I do? Using the 20W adapter for charging and usb that comes inside the box with the phone.

Ive owned an SE for a few years. Its at 89 percent battery amazingly but I get pretty awful battery life. I love the size but its not the best. My phone is my main device except the rare occasion I use a computer. 

One thing is Im a pro musician and tour and play 4-5 nights a week (even right now in Florida) so I love getting pictures in the bars and restaurants. Its usually modestly lit to pretty dark. One thing Im not sure about is telephoto, when are realistic situations I would use that? 

Based on all of this I feel like I should just go ProMax and get used to the size.

Really my questions: battery of SE 2016 vs 12 mini and 12 ProMax

What are the legit usages of telephoto vs zoom?

Does LIDAR help with the night shots I take?

Kinda annoying, even if it is an issue with the apps just not being optimized yet.

After reading about potential autofocus issues up close, noticed something strange. After taking a picture, when viewing the photo in camera roll, it appears that processing on the image then happens as you can see the image adjust. Does everyone's iPhone 12 Pro do this? Note even if I don't look at the image for a bit, upon that first open of the image, it seems to adjust.

I had an iPhone 8. Purchased the 12 and have spent less than 24 hours with it, enjoying the beautiful bigger screen and the design. Using the Apple silicone case, one handed use although not really uncomfortable, it has been a bit of a balancing and hands get tired after 2,3 hours of use non stop. I have medium hands, 8 was getting small when typing and amongst other things such as battery since I watch a lot of content plus screen estate, since I dont have an iPad. But now I am having second thoughts, should I go for the Mini? Its still slightly bigger yet smaller foot print than 8. Anyone else jumped from 8 to 12? Or planning on getting mini?

The iPhone 12 has a big problem with hearing aid connectivity. See below link

https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251978336

Booming static in one ear hopping into the other and audio cuts out. I have spoken to Apple support who says theyre aware of the issue as of a couple weeks or so ago, but havent heard anything since. Not sure where else to go. I just wanted to let any potential hard of hearing buyer know to hang on to their current phone as the hearing aids are non usable at this point.

Hello,

My name is Dan and I'm the developer of the IndusMag MagSafe Wallet/Cardholder.

I've seen a spike of traffic from Reddit and found a post on here. I'd like to further explain my product so that you truly understand what I've done and stop any misinformation about my brand.

Why am I posting this? 2 reasons. First, I see some people talking about my MagSafe Wallet and saying it's the same as what you can find on Aliexpress. This is not true. This confusion has lead to a lot of orders and prompt cancellations which is causing me a lot of costs for nothing in payment services. Second, there is a competitor who has tried sending me fake letters from Apple that I see replying to every comment/post about my product and trying to push his with a weaker magnet. I don't mind competition but I do mind my product which I've poured hundreds of hours into being wrongfully bad-mouthed.

**Apple uses a .6mm thick magnet in their MagSafe array. After seeing early reviews, it was very obvious to me that this would NOT work properly to hold a wallet. I've used these types of wallets with an adhesive for the past 5 years, so I wanted to solve that problem.**

I spent a lot of time and money developing the tooling to create the same array pattern with a thicker magnet. Seems pretty simple but it was costly and I had to hire an engineer to ensure I was within the parameters of Apples MagSafe Developer Guidelines and also to pay to retool my own set of machines to fit the magnet inside of the leather without tearing current tooling available overseas ([https://developer.apple.com/accessories/Accessory-Design-Guidelines.pdf](https://developer.apple.com/accessories/Accessory-Design-Guidelines.pdf))

I don't use Reddit. I don't market on here, I simply try my best in these trying times to A) Solve a problem for the community and B) make some extra money. I'm disappointed that my time and effort is being grouped together with other products that are simply being shipped over here from China with no thought or effort going into them.

You can see the video of my product listed on my website ([https://indusmag.com/](https://indusmag.com/))

I have additional information on my Etsy Page:

So this is the first iphone in our family, bought it as a present to my wife and the biggest issue are these random spot flares which are easily seen during evening/night time shooting with street lights nearby. 

They are seen only when shooting on the main camera mode, if using wide angle or zoom they are either not present at all or nearly invisible. 

When shooting from the same spot on my Note 20 Ultra (no matter which angle) there can be some light spots (usually 1-2 faint ones), but not as bad as on the main iphone camera. 

Does this seem like a defect?

Hi guys, 

I'm looking at [this deal](https://www.virginmedia.com/mobile/pay-monthly/apple/iphone-12-mini?colour=Blue&amp;storage=128&amp;contractDuration=36&amp;tariffID=1343335187) with Virgin Mobile, it's for an iPhone 12 mini 128gb:

0 Upfront

37/pm

100GB data/pm

&amp;#x200B;

It's a 36 month contract but I'm sort of fine with that as I dont expect to be getting a new phone in the next three years anyway. 

&amp;#x200B;

Virgin unfortunately doesn't yet have 5G but they told me they expect to be rolling it out mid way through next year, so not a huge delay. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any comments or thoughts gratefully received - Thanks!

My main goal with the Max was battery life. I dont care about the improved camera as the 12 Pro's Camera is miles better than my old 8+. The size isnt really that much of an issue with the Max but I prefer the smaller and lighter iPhone 12 Pro. Oh man, Ive never been this indecisive when buying an iPhone... I really need your advice. I question literally every decision Ive made so far.. buying the Pro, ordering the Max, returning the pro... literally everything

Im coming from Android and the autocorrect seemed to be very aggressive and wrong for the most part. 

After looking around I found that by disabling Predictive Autocorrect it makes a worlds of difference:
Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Keyboard -&gt; under all keyboards go ahead and disable predictive and typing becomes much better.

I hope this helps someone, happy Monday.

Anyone else experiencing really bad battery life with the 12 Pro? I just unplugged my phone at 9:19 PM. My phone is already at 65% at 12:31 AM. I havent used it much at all. My phone also gets hot just being on Facebook or browsing Safari for 10-15 minutes. I thought my X had bad battery issues, but I guess I spoke too soon...

Yellow screen: compared to my X, the 12 Pro screen has a hint of yellow to it. I do not have night shift turned on. Is this faulty?

So I went to get the Pro and no one had it in stock. Not in til Dec 3. I just couldnt go through Thanksgiving with the fam without the nice camera. So I went ahead got the regular 12. I plan on using it for my upcoming InstaGram and YouTube channels. One of my dog and one thats sort of a patient advocate channel. 

Am I gonna regret it? Should I take it back and just wait? Is the camera really a lot better? Having some fomo.

Can anyone please explain to me how the MagSafe iPhone charger is considered wireless? Its not like a traditional charging pad where you set the phone down, pick it up and go. With the MagSafe, you have to physically grab the cord/pad and hold it down to release the magnets from the phone, essentially making it an actual connection just like the traditional charger itself. This concept is really stupid to me and I dont understand how its considered wireless. Someone explain.

Hey guys, so I preordered my iPhone 12 Pro Max when preorders opened on Friday in the UK. But Ive not received an official order confirmation email and I havent been charged.

Its been confirmed with the Apple Business Team (I get to put my phone as a business expense cos Im a freelancer) but other than that Ive heard nothing from Apple.

Just want to know if anyone else is the same in the UK? I want my phone fast, as I was one of the first to preorder (using the business team), but apparently thats not a factor in the race to getting our beloved phones first! Whats this process like for anyone else?

Going to pull the trigger today, the store closes soon. Either the 12 or the mini, which one? Currently on an iPhone 8. Use will be heavy content watching (Netflix/YouTube etc), heavy social media use, browsing net, heavy music listening. One handed use will be nice. Do not have an iPad only a Mac. Also will be getting a silicone case and a screen protector installed by Apple (regarding the screen protector, should I get it installed today or go back after a week and get it installed like I have been doing since I have had iPhones, reason for this question is seeing a lot of people complaining about scratches on their phone within a few days with very light use) also which wall charger should I get? The 20W Apple or not, currently only have the standard 5W brick adapter that came with the 8.

Hey guys, 

I just found a workaround to share your beautiful Dolby Vision HDR videos on Instagram without looking overexposed.

You probably just got a new iPhone 12/pro/max/mini. You were blown away by how good the video you just recorded looks on your phone and you just cant wait to share it on your Instagram story...

Only to find out that Instagram completely ruins it. If you were like me, you probably tried taking a screen recording and posting it. But the screen recordings are not as bright and colourful as the original video.

Lucky for you, I just found a workaround. Here are the steps you can take to upload your Dolby Vision HDR video on your Instagram story:
1. Go to Instagram stories and cover your camera lens to take a black picture.
2. Swipe up and select the gallery option
3. Select the video
4. Post it

Thank me later!

Received some ESR cases so thought I would test them out and put up some pictures, as well as links in case anyone is interested in getting one.

First case is the clear glass case. It's a hard polycarbonate case that feels like glass, very rigid and should provide excellent protection. Fits nicely, and provides good camera protection as well as screen protection when the phone is put down on it's front.

\[img\]https://i.ibb.co/bXW5Xv5/ESR1.jpg\[/img\]

\[img\]https://i.ibb.co/McgSjmd/ESR2.jpg\[/img\]

Second case I tried was the kickstand clear case. This is a softer type case with a lot more of a rubber like feel. Should provide more impact resistance as it will absorb impacts better I think. It also has a nice metal kick stand built into the rear which allows you to sit the phone down in a number of positions to view it either at your desk or at home when watching videos etc. Buttons feel very nice and clicky too which is always nice.

\[img\]https://i.ibb.co/nQy7RxW/ESR4.jpg\[/img\]

\[img\]https://i.ibb.co/N9392sg/ESR5.jpg\[/img\]

The last case I tried was the silicone case. This is pretty similar to that of the Apple case just without the price. It is fully MagSafe compatible and does have the ring inside the case much like the genuine Apple cases have. Very nice feel in the hand, buttons feel great, the blue is like a royal blue (doesn't look cheap) and it fits the phone perfectly.

\[img\]https://i.ibb.co/r50czbD/ESR7.jpg\[/img\]

\[img\]https://i.ibb.co/XXmfbTV/ESR8.jpg\[/img\]

All the cases were of very high quality, I've bought ESR products in the past and they've always fitted and lasted well. So if anyone is looking for alternative options, these are well worth a look.

Any drawbacks to ordering Chinese/HK 12 Pro Max? I live in the US but the US variant only supports one physical and one E-Sim

I have two phone numbers. One for business and the other for personal. My carrier does not support e-SIM so Id like to use a phone that works with two physical SIMs. 

Ive read that the Chinese and Hong Kong variant both support dual physical SIMs but was wondering if I would be losing any features by importing one to the US? 

Otherwise I have to carry two phones around which can be annoying at times.

Hi, I currently have a Samsung galaxy s10 and after a decade of using androids, I am contemplating trying out ios. I do have a MacBook and iPad so I guess I'm fully integrating into the ecosystem now. It's just that I'm kinda bored of android now and want some change. I'm really don't know which iPhone I should get. My galaxy s10 does have a telephoto camera and I use it sometimes. So I really don't know if I'll miss it. Designwise I really like the shiny edges of the iPhone 12 pro. The iPhone 12 mini however is such an interesting form factor. When I first got my galaxy s10, I really didn't like how wide it was. I got used to it now. But I still sometimes think it would be nice to have a slightly smaller phone. (Mainly when I want to use my phone one-handed). The iPhone 12 mini seems really tempting for that reason. I'm just not sure if the battery life will be sufficient for my use. It's not that I'm a heavy user, but when using my galaxy I often fall 1-2h short to make it through my day. Maybe this is a dumb question, but how does ios scale for the smaller iPhone? Does it just shrink the apps, or do the letters have the same size, and will you be able to see less on the screen of the phone? 

I'd like to thank everyone for helping me in advance!

Hi everyone. Recently came over to an iPhone from years in the the Google Nexus/Pixel series. Picked up an iPhone 12 and this thing eats through the battery and gets incredibly hot on the left hand side. Is this normal for this phone? I couldnt find anything online outside of reviews on YouTube or on older devices. I was thinking that 5G is eating the battery but it still burns through it on WiFi. 

Thanks in advance for your help.

I have been thinking about this for a long time. I have seen many people say that its fine and doesnt cause any issues but also many people saying that its harmful for the battery. I personally charge my phone overnight, I dont see the logic on waking up in the morning and having to plug in the battery to charge before going to work/school, you should have the phone ready to go immediately when you wake up IMO. Idk I just find it odd and it makes charging feel scheduled. Whats your take on this?

So its time for an upgrade and just my luck, the latest model doesnt include any rose gold options. Im kind of more upset about this than I thought Id be. Has anyone found a good rose gold work around case for the 12/12pro yet? What color phone do you get that compliments it best? I currently have the 8 rose gold and I love the subtlety of it. So disappointed. Anyone else?

This is the only place I could think of that could help.

The magnets on the 12 Pro max are strong. My missus has just ordered 1 but if she uses a wallet case will it damage them? Obvs won't keep them there if using a wireless charger!

Thanks in advance!

I am trying to use the pip feature that I use on ipad but it does not work in my iphone12. I have selected it in the settings menu and then restarted the phone and checked again, it does not work! When I watch a video in full screen on safari the option to see pip is there but the window resizes, becomes small and then disappears! The option never comes up in YouTube app.

Going to pull the trigger today, the store closes soon. Either the 12 or the mini, which one? Currently on an iPhone 8. Use will be heavy content watching (Netflix/YouTube etc), heavy social media use, browsing net, heavy music listening. One handed use will be nice. Do not have an iPad only a Mac. Also will be getting a silicone case and a screen protector installed by Apple (regarding the screen protector, should I get it installed today or go back after a week and get it installed like I have been doing since I have had iPhones, reason for this question is seeing a lot of people complaining about scratches on their phone within a few days with very light use) also which wall charger should I get? The 20W Apple or not, currently only have the standard 5W brick adapter that came with the 8.

Hey,

I got my 12 pro 10 days ago. I switched from android for the first time ever. Not regretting it, phone seems solid, especially the camera. Am facing though three issues.... 
1. The screen seems a bit yellow, especially when I compare it with my Samsung phone, my laptop screen (which is quite good) etc. Does any else face this?
2. Signal drops every now and then. It comes back rather fast but still... no reason for that... had perfect signal with my note10
3. The settings menu does not seem to rotate... whatever I tried its is stuck in portrait mode and does not go to landscape.
I recently updated the phone to 14.2.
Anyone else facing these? Did you manage to solve them??? Thanks!

I preordered an iPhone 12 Mini Black.
I did quite an extensive research and at the end I ordered a TOZO thin case and TORRAS Edge to edge screen protector (pack of 2).
I like my phones to as minimal as possible.
I would go with a naked phone (like my current iPhone 6) but all the messages about iPhone 12 and 12 Pro getting scratched made me thinking.
Anyone doing a minimal protection setup to share?

Hey folks,
I am looking to get the IPhone 12, in particular the 256gb version. Where i live, this phone costs 1042. I recently noticed that the 12 pro with 128gb of storage is only about 80 more (1120). My question  is: If i am already willing to go beyond 1000 ($1190) when buying a new phone, should i just slice off half my desired storage space and pay an extra 80 to go for the 128gb 12pro? Are the features worth it? Or should i stick with getting the 12... 
I will be happy about any help and information, 
thanks in advance!

hi guys I have just updated to iPhone 12 from iPhone 11. and I own 18W Charger (That came with iPhone 11 Pro) and the 5W charger that came out with the iPhone 11.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I am from the country where I won't be able to change the battery in my device I would like to take care of my battery health as much as I can.   


(on iPhone 11 I managed to maintain 100% Battery health in 4 months and 100% Battery health in 7 months on iPhone XR).

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you think on what charger would I go for ?

&amp;#x200B;

Charge via MacBook (Have personal MacBook Pro 2020 or Macbook 12 (at work)

&amp;#x200B;

vs

&amp;#x200B;

5W Charger 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

18W Charger.

Hi all,

I am torn between the 12 and 12 pro. I don't really need the extra camera features, but I do like the high end look of the 12 pro and cost isn't a huge concern. My question is about comfort in hand. The lighter weight of the 12 is tempting. For those who have tried both, is the 12 considerably lighter and more comfortable to use? is the comfort level worth serious consideration before springing for the fancier phone? I am coming from an iphone X

Thanks!

I work in San Antonio which has 5g which is fast. but w ATT I got terrible service on my xs at my house, which is in the bfe/middle of nowhere. I have no issues now and have such fast service. I rely on my phone for internet as we cannot get traditional wi-fi, so its such a sweet upgrade.

My battery has been lasting me about 13-14 hours a day and Id have somewhere around 30-40% battery by 9pm. The other night I was using my phone and it got very hot. Not sure why it was, but maybe something was running in the background. Today I used my phone and it seems like the battery was draining faster than normal. I took it off the charger at 4:30am somehow, woke up at 8:30 and my phone was at 100%. Once I started to use it, battery seemed to drain faster than usual. I was at 40% by around 7pm when usually its at 40% around 9. I wasnt doing anything much different on my phone, other than using gps and zoom for a small period of time. However, I usually take it off the charger at 8/9am on a regular day.

I am currently most interested in Bellroy's 3 card case since it has a sleek look and seems protective but have read a ton of mixed reviews. Would love to hear recommendations! 

Also, if you have any suggestions outside of a 3 card case I would be happy to hear as well. Thanks.

Apparently I took my phone off the charger in the middle of the night (I dont remember doing this). I woke up and I found my phone unplugged, so I must have. However, my battery was at 100% when I woke up around 8:30. and My battery was seemingly draining a little faster that normal and Im a little concerned. Usually around 2ish my battery level is in the upper 70s and it was in the upper 60s at the same time, but I guess that varies depending on what youre doing. 

Even before I went to bed last night I was browsing amazon (was at home on wifi) and during that time, my phone started to get really hot and I couldnt hold it. It wasnt even on the charger when it got really hot either. I had to turn it off to let it cool down. Im not sure if this did something to the battery or not.

Today, I got to check out the iPhone 12 in person in blue colour. There was iPhone 11 Pro just beside it. So I got to check both of them side by side.

iPhone 12 was better to hold and swipes from sides were not as uncomfortable as thought itd be and thats all what I liked about it. The bezels actually look thicker than they are!! I know theyre thinner than 11 pro but the illusion is due to the flat design and that makes the design look dated to me to be honest.

iPhone 11 pro looked modern to me. The curved design has its own benefits. For one, you could make a phone lot  thicker and fit a larger battery but it feels thinner in hand and also our palms are comfortable holding onto things that are curved rather than flat edges.

I knowI will be downvoted for hating Apples new design but anyway, this is all my opinions. Im pretty sure rest of the industry will follow this trend. Because they just copy what Apple does and dont have ballz to do some thing on their own. I guess I will just get used to it.

Got an Anker Nano 18W Fast Charger because Apple doesn't give a Adapter anymore. It charges from 0 to 80 percent in like 45 minutes, then from 80 percent to 100 it takes like 30 to 35 minutes just to charge an extra 20 percent. Why is this?

I already have a big phone in Note 20 Ultra, so for a secondary phone that will primarily serve as a call/iMessage/dual SIM/casual photos/browsing, I am intrigued about the Mini.

The only concern is the battery life, but according to Apple's website, it lists the same amount of video playback time as XS Max.  If this phone has battery endurance equal to XS Max when it was launched, I would be ecstatic!

I just hope the endurance isn't terrible.  The only reason that may keep me from preordering.

Still undecided on which phone to get. Just living vicariously through the sub 

But for real, i love the way the 3 cameras look and kinda really want lidar. Mini would be my first choice in size sunce my current phone is the original SE and love the compact size

But the 12 seems to be a real nice fit in the hand too.. and still relatively lightweight

I haven't had an iPhone since the 4 and have had Galaxies since then. I was going back and forth between the green 12 and blue 12 Pro. I ordered a 128MB Pro and the arrival is Nov 11-18th. I am seriously considering canceling the pro and going with the 256MB green which would arrive Nov 4. I tend to take a lot of pictures mainly of my kids. Not sure if the cameras are different enough for me to hang on to the pro in favor of more memory. I am nervous not being able to have the expandable memory.

I upgraded from iPhone XS Max, which now only has 89% battery capacity. I usually just use my phone for emails, lots of social media, YouTube, and Spotify when on the go. My Xs would have about 30-40% by the end of day. My iPhone 12 pro would be down to 10% around 6 pm. Anyone else having issue with getting accustomed to a, what appears to be, smaller battery life?

I use Settings app frequently to access and manage my Bluetooth connections and find that its unresponsive at least once per day.  Pressing anywhere on the screen with the Bluetooth menu is useless. I can swipe up to exit, force quit the app and restart, but when I restart it takes about 4 seconds to reopen after a black screen. Anyone experience this?

I bought an unlocked iPhone 12 Pro and got it on launch day but turns out the volume button is defective. The only iPhone 12 Pro I can find near me is a Verizon model to trade for. Are there any differences between the two, and is the Verizon one locked?

So I bought the iPhone 12 Pro in silver and it should get here Friday. Im trying to decide on a clear case to buy. I dont want it to be too bulky and I kind of want to keep the aesthetic of the phone in tact to make it feel like I almost dont have a case on at all. However, I do want there to be a little bit of protection still there in case I happen to drop it. Any suggestions on which clear case meets these standards?

Using iPhone 8 for 2 years now and its time to upgrade, torn between the sizes. A lot of content watching (Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, etc), Reddit/safari browsing, typing/texting/email, heavy social media browsing. One hand use is very high on the list. Did go into the Apple store and compared the 12 to my 8. On paper 12 is heavier but seemed lighter compared to the 8 in person.

So I have been really thinking about upgrading and switch carriers to get the iPhone 12 for free by trading in my iPhone X. However, ATT is asking for a 300 dollars of down payment, which I know they will give me back anyways. I am ok with my iPhone X no complains but this deal is just so good to pass up! Also right now I have a concessions line with Verizon and I am getting an amazing discount, though I technically switch jobs and I dont know how long its going to last. I would have to pay an extra 20 dollars a month for 30 months if I compare it to what I am paying now with Verizon . Would you you guys still pull the trigger and pay the 300 dollars of down payment and be ok with paying more per month ? I think its just an incredible deal to pass up and the last day will be this Thursday to take advantage of this deal !!!! Ugh !

I currently own the iPhone 12 Pro Max and I love it. I came from the iPhone 8+ and the smaller size is something I really enjoy. The only thing is that the Battery Life isnt as great as I hoped it would be. Its nothing major but every evening I think to myself damn, if only it lasted 2 hours longer. According to Apple the 12 Pro Max does just that. 

Would you return the 12 Pro for the 12 Pro Max just for the bigger battery? (The Camera upgrade is nice but I dont usually take low-light shots anyway.) I'm very conflicted especially since I like this new 6.1 size so much. Thanks for your advice

There are so few MagSafe accessories available right now, which makes sense given its infancy. I  am not inclined to buy the first available products, as I expect newer ones will come out that improve the initial products.  Or new products all together that I would rather spend my money on. 

What do you think are some realistic, near term (I.e., one month) accessories you either expect to see coming out or would like to see?

So I noticed this once I got my iPhone 12 and did a few facetime calls with my friends: Most of them were already on IOS 14 but I was the only one using an iPhone 12

While Face timing I was able to exit out of the Facetime App causing my friends Feed to go in picture in picture mode. and I was able to go into other apps (Facebook, Twitter, Chrome etc) without my video pausing on my friends end.

I tested this out on almost every facetime call I've done since getting the iPhone 12 and even asked my friends on iPhone 11 if it worked for them and it seems like this feature is exclusive to the iPhone 12, pretty neat!

I picked up an Apple Product Red Silicone case for my 12 Pro to ensure Id have a case when the phone arrived. I was REALLY excited and I loved the red color....but after a week or so with it Im not sure I am anymore and for $50 it seems like it might make sense to return it. The 12 Pro is bigger than my XS, and therefore harder to slide in and out of pockets...the silicone just makes this harder. I also picked up a $4.50 clear case with a hard back from Amazon and frankly I almost like it better. Other than the MagSafe capabilities of my Apple silicone case....I feel like I could take it or leave it. Im also really wondering if its the silicone itself and not the case, and I should get a MagSafe leather case when it comes out. I have to assume 3rd party companies will also make MagSafe cases?  I financed it on my Apple Card, so $4.05 a month is a cup of coffee...not the end of the world. But still...

Hey guys, so I just ordered a iPhone 12 pro and is around 2 weeks out. I got a bunch of iPhone 11 screen protectors (Not edge to edge but the ones with the cutout that only cover the display area). Given that they're both 6.1" would the 11 SP still fit the 12?

So i have an Iphone 6s right now, and i dont know if is should go for an iphone 12 or 12 mini?

The 6s fits perfectly in my hands, but i saw that the iphone 12 mini is smaller than the 6s. The display is larger but the whole phone is smaller, so i dont know if its going to be to small. Or if the iphone is going to be too big, or is it just a thing to get used to a bigger/smaller phone.

Battery on the 12 is better than 12 mini. So i dont really know if i should go for an 12 or 12 mini?

What are your opinions to that? Yall copping the 12 or 12 mini? Should i take the lil bit bigger phone or the lil bit smaller phone :/

On Friday my iPhone 12 arrived, an upgrade from my iPhone 8. I knew immediately when I had both phones powered on next to each other, that there was a stark difference between screen brightness and warmth on both models. 

The iPhone 12 screen is simply not as bright on full brightness. It is also much more warm in tone. iPhone 8 is much brighter and bluer. 

I made sure to have the settings exactly the same, full brightness, true tone on (also tested with True Tone off on both), no other tweaks to the screen settings - on both phones. 

Compared to my wifes iPhone 11 and same settings, it appears to look the same in comparison to my old iPhone 8. Her phone is also brighter and bluer. 

I am noticing that I need to have my iPhone 12 screen on full brightness all the time so far, even inside my house. This is not something I ever needed to do with my iPhone 8.

I know the 12 apparently has and OLED screen, and that the other models have LCD. But shouldnt this better screen on the 12 be brighter? 

I am wondering if this is normal or a defective device, and if anyone else has noticed the same thing, especially when upgrading from an older model. Thanks.

Question for people who are lucky enough to already have the 12 Pro in their hands...

What's the battery life like when gaming? I'm skeptical of the 2815mah battery. I know that performance is virtually unbeatable on iPhone because of the A14 bionic chip. But battery life is very important too and if it can't hold charge when gaming then please let me know.

Anyone willing to test/already tested? Interested in high intensive games such as CoD Mobile, PUBG, Genshin Impact, Apple Arcade games including Oceanhorn 2 etc. So this question isn't really relevant to Candy Crush, Coin Master, etc.

Just upgraded from an iPhone X to an iPhone 12.

Tried to send a photo to a friend that doesn't have an iPhone.  It wouldn't send and got a message that effectively said I have to turn on MMS.  Checked the settings and MMS was turned ON.

Huh?

Called iPhone support and they said I have to turn off iMessage to send photos to non-iPhones.  Okay, so I cannot use iMessage ever if I have any friends who don't have iPhones?  Otherwise, I have to go into settings and turn it on and off all the time?

So I turned off iMessage, but now the iPhone 12 would not send photos via text messaging to my friends and family who had iPhones, so I had to turn it back on.

So I have to know which friends have iPhones and which do not and then have to go into settings each time I send a message based on what type of phone I am sending it to?  The Apple support person effectively said "Yes."  Huh?

I am so confused.

I did not have to muck around with that kind of setting with my previous iPhone X.

A big reason I get Apple stuff is because it just works and their great tech support.  In this case both the iPhone 12 and the tech support let me down.

Any of you know what I am doing wrong?

When my Mom and Dad tell me I cant have the new iPhone iPhone 12, I will admit I went a little bit crazy. I let my anger come out all at once and to say the least the iPhone is not the only thing I yelled about.... after this they tel me I will get a tablet with Talkatone app next time my phone breaks , and I will never have a new Brand phone in my time under there roof. To say the least I am devastated

Right now I am stuck with iPhone 11 as you can see [here](https://i.imgur.com/NSHLYWx.jpg) and its not even iPhone 11 Pro. I really need upgrade I feel like this is not fair I dont want iPhone 11 I think this is almost abuse and if this breaks I am doomed

I charged my iPhone, made sure that it was charging, leave it for about 30 minutes, and when I checked, the iPhone was not charging anymore. Tried on different wireless charging supporting phones and on different power bricks, still doesnt work. Pretty sure the problem is on the MagSafe. 

I dont know what may cause the problem. I use it just as normal as it is.

Hey

I moved from an 11 Pro.

My battery life seems to be way worse on the iPhone 12.

Normally I would go from 100%-90% in 2/3 hours, on the iPhone 12 its like an hour.

Every time I check my battery percentage every 20 mins or so its always going down.

Ive optimised settings for battery life and seems to still not doing much. Background app refresh etc.

Like yeah its still decent battery life I can last a whole day near enough.

Anyone else disappointed with the battery life?

New iPhone 12 owner here!

I bought the 20W charger because I thought I was gonna use it all the time. However, because I come from an iPhone 7 Plus I have the 5W charger, and I noticed the battery is just great (I had on 78% the iPhone 7 Plus one), so I think I won't need the 20W charger. I also used the 5W one to charge it over night and I had no problem.

Thoughts on this?

On the Apple website it says that if I buy through T-Mobile, I'll get $30 off and requires activation. What does activation necessarily entail? I am currently a T Mobile customer. If I switch over my sim card from my current phone to the iPhone, does that count and will the iPhone work?

The app works fine on WiFi, but will not stream over cellular, and, yes, I checked to ensure cellular data was turned on for streaming. Every other streaming app works fine, except Netflix.

When I try to do anything over cellular, even just signing in, the app times out and I get Network Error, having trouble establishing a connection. Try again later.

For additional battery savings, enable night mode in apps (Reddit has its own OLED "midnight" dark mode), and use a black image as your phones background!

Disclaimer: some new "low end" iPhones such as the iphone Xr and iPhone 11 still have LCD displays, which will not gain any extra battery with this method.

Ive been using my new iPhone 12 Pro now for a week and have to say the battery life is fantastic, compared to my old 8 Plus.

The iPhone 12 seems to get a lot of flack for having low battery capacity, doesnt seem to matter in my experience.

This is my first iPhone. Ive been a Samsung loyalist ever since smartphones were a thing. The industrys forced adoption of curved is better had me thinking it was futuristic and superior. But I cannot tell you how much I prefer this boxy and flat design. It was a part of the temptation to finally make the switch and am very glad I did.

Mainly when opening and closing apps, as well going into multitasking/app switcher, Ill see a slight stutter in the animation. This doesnt happen every time but it does occasionally happen. With some apps it happens more often than others. Is this normal?

Has anyone been driving around while using 5G GPS with their iphone connected to a MagSafe? I have to take mine out of my case to do so, so it has room to vent. 

It stops charging at 80% to prevent overheat (read this is the protocol for wireless charging in iOS) but it so damn hot when I take it off or touch it to change songs...

So I recently bought the iPhone 12 in white and wow, It's not white at all. The back is cream colored and almost looks yellow in some lighting, the sides are not pure silver they have a champagne tint to them. I like it a lot but I can imagine some people not liking it if they expected a really white phone like previous white iPhones.

Im not sure how my phone screen scratched but I have two already, Im very careful to never carry it in a pocket with any metal in it, but they got there some how. 

Bummed cause my phone got here 4 days ahead of the screen protectors and case, so Im hoping no more scratches will form and that the screen protector will hide them.

Its not great. Its definitely worse than the 11 pro.

Hi all!

I am planning to buy an iPhone 12 Mini (white or black), and I am looking for a case and screen protector.About the case - I am looking for a thin and minimal one. I do not like bulky cases as I usually keep my phones caseless.About the screen protector - I am looking for a thin edge to edge one just to protect from scratches.

Any suggestion about best products available that can suit my need?

Thanks to all!

Ho-ly. Shit. 

I quite literally doubled in generations and the difference is astonishing. The 12 is a fantastic phone. I can't over how good the battery life is and just how quick it is.

I switched from a phone that had a higher refresh rate screen (90 Hz vs the iPhone 60 Hz). Everything on this phone seems far less snappy and smooth. I didn't think the difference in refresh rate would make *that* big of a difference. But it...does? I am considering returning the 12 and going with something else. I am quite disappointed, I thought iPhones were supposed to be smooth as butter, but I'm finding it's not the case. Should I return it or wait and see if my eyes adjust normally?

I didnt realize how much I disliked the curved edges of the phones Ive had over the years until I got the iPhone 12.

On the iPhone 12 Pro, when I access the camera, the available zoom options are .5, 1x and 2x.  You can then slide it up to 10x, but that is obviously digital zoom.

Not too sure if sliding it to 4x is still optical, but if I set it to 4x and then switch back to 1x, the 4x reverts back to 2x as the option without sliding the wheel.  Can anyone confirm the 4x on the little sliding wheel is actually optical?

Weird that it isn't available as a preset like .5, 1x, and 2x and you have to fumble with the wheel to access it.

I bought the iPhone 12 Pro and considering returning for Pro Max. I always like to have the best camera I can get on an iPhone, but I don't if I can justify the extra cost, and the very large display. Will the camera specs on the Pro Max make that much of a drastic change to be worth it? I know the obvious answer would be to wait and see, but I don't want to return my phone then have to wait for it to ship again, especially with the high demand of the iPhone 12 Pros.

So Ive had the iPhone 12 pro for about 5 days. Today I was showing a YouTube video to a friend. Looked away for a second then looked back and my phone looked like it had a cyan filter over it. All pixels that were supposed to be white were now a cyan color. I dont know if I pressed anything specifically, but where something like that even be placed. When I would switch over apps, it would go away momentarily but when the transition animation was done, it would be back to cyan. I restarted the phone and it went away but I dont want it to be a faulty screen then have to replace it out of pocket later. Anyone have an idea of what happened? Or if should call apple to get it replaced? Thanks!

I'm sure there have been similar posts/topics so not sure how much attention this thread will get.

I've been with Android pretty much since their inception but I've been pondering on finally switching (for various reasons) and I finally got the pacific blue iphone 12 and boy, it is gorgeous.

I'm also that guy that will have accessories ready prior to the phone because I hear a lot of stories about iphone screens easily cracking. I reluctantly spent $25 on the invisishield but WOW, the display looks just the same and retained all of its bright colors. I'm also OCD about air bubbles so I slapped on the screen protector on the phone right outta the box!Because this was my first iPhone ever, and in blue, I made sure to get a clear case to show off the color and logo. Had it for 3 days now but battery has been above average with moderate use but I do use my MacBook a lot so that helps. 

No battery brick? No prob. Been charging it with my Samsung dual wireless charger but I did also just receive my anker USB C charger for on the go.

But I'll have a better idea on my experience after at least a week but until then it's been a pleasant experience and looking forward to engaging with the new iPhone 12 community. Of course, I welcome any cool tips or advice.

Best Screen Protector for IPhone 12 (new iPhone user)

Im totally new from Android and luckily got a good deal on iPhone 12 so hoping so kinda get good protection (I know ceramic shield and all is truly protective but its wayyy to fragile feeling for me to go without a case and screen protector.) but Im more open to thinner or clear cases and weaker but maybe more vivid screen protectors as this point because of it though. 

Im picking up the clear mous case, hopefully not too bulky (does anyone have this and knows how it looks/feels?)

Does anyone know iPhones best screen protector? Honestly if it means a more vivid or slick screen, I dont care about price for it. What screen protectors bring through the most light the nicest to touch and swipe for iOS gestures etc, does anyone have their opinions?

TIA!!!!!!!!!!

So I am currently using an iPhone 8 and need to upgrade to 12 but unsure as to which model, I was torn between the 3 available models but after walking into the store and having first hand experience, the Pro seems heavy and I don't need the extras included such as the camera, the ram might be nice but I am sure 4GB will be enough for me (do plan to keep the phone for 4 years) also 128GB capacity. I was considering the mini because of the size since I am on iPhone8. but after holding the 12 in my hand, the weight seemed light and comfortable as far as the screen, I mean I have to stretch my thumb a little to reach top right or left but it seemed nice, I also then put on the MagSafe case on it and it was still light (will be using a case and a screen protector: please recommended a good secondary case for the phone, and a good primary glass screen protector. People who upgraded from 8 to 12 or pro how are you doing with the size? Is there a part of you that wants to switch to the Mini from the 12 or pro because it's not as comfortable with one hand use. I am aware that Mini is not out yet but just based on the size and how is your comfort level, I do a lot of browsing reddit, texting/typing, movies(usually have objects that I can lean the phone on, but also one hand use in transit (bus or train while standing and holding the rail).

I have had my iPhone 12 Pro for 2 days.  So far i have only put it in clean cotton pockets without any other things, or on a soft cotton surface (until my case arrived i figured carrying a small washcloth with me to set it on would help keep it free of scratches).  Well, it has 3 rather deep scratches, in 2 days, after only being placed in/on soft cotton surfaces.  To my knowledge cotton is not higher than a 7 on the mohs hardness scale.  What gives?

Hi iPhone 12 fans!

I've just got my iPhone 12 Pro (very happy with it) but I'm struggling to find a case that has a large enough gap around the lightning port to accommodate some of the accessories I use without an extension adapter. 

I'm specifically using microphones like the rode videomic and the Zoom IQ7. The extension plug works fine but I'm a bit jittery with it and have already come close to accidentally snapping it once or twice. 

I'm certain it's a long-shot, but wondered if anyone had found a case that was suitable who use similar accessories?

Do you guys reckon this is a problem that can be fixed with a software update? Or is this a hardware issue that the only way you can fix it, is by playing "screen lottery".

If your Pro was bought on launch day, then the Maxs first preorder day is the last or second-to-last day to exchange it through Apple depending on country. 

Im stuck due to the camera upgrades. Apple is touting it as 87% better, but in digging through the fine print it seems theyre comparing it to the 11 Pro Max. Sure the 12 Maxs sensor is larger on the wide lens, but its telephoto has a smaller aperture and a longer zoom than the regular Pro (both will darken the photos, especially the former). However. I could be super wrong next week when the reviews begin getting published. Thoughts?

So this past Saturday afternoon, I walked into an Apple store with the intention to purchase an iPhone 12 Pro. I knew what I wanted and what options I was looking for and even had a couple of backups planned. Unfortunately they were out of the Pro's. Bummer at first I thought. Then I looked further into the the regular 12. I thought, a little less money and for what? An extra camera, a little better zoom and a LIDAR scanner I would probably never use. 

I talked for a bit with the rep who was very knowledgeable and I decided that I would instead buy the regular 12 in the white color.  (128GB) I bought the MagSafe charger and the brick there but decided to get a case elsewhere. I went home and set the phone up and popped my SIM card in and.... well..... I was kinds impressed but not much there. the first couple of days it just seemed like a better version of my old phone. Then I found out to take advantage of the 5g on my cellular network it requires an upgrade. So I went and had it done and once the 5g kicked in, WOW!!!! Immediately noticed a huge difference. Every device on my account got "Turbo Boosted." My phone, the iPhone 12 was in "hyper speed." 

Over the last 2 days my son's xR and My wife's xR don't cut out anywhere while they are on the move and I seem to have lost all the "dead spots." My series 5 watch absolutely loves the connection to this phone. It seems to last a few hours longer than it used to now. Actually it's a lot longer. 20 hours and counting there. The battery life on the phone is great too.  I am on the beta so I do expect it to be a little off but so far it's been fabulous. 

So in the end, I went looking for the Pro model but I settled on the regular 12 and couldn't be happier!! Thanks for reading and have fun with your phones and look forward to what Apple has in store because it's gonna be great!!!

It's not the cable or charger because iPhone 11 Pro (my wife's) and iPhone 8 (my work cell) both charge wireless on these units. 

I'm on iOS 14.1.

iPhone OLED not totally black

Looking at a completely darkened page or photo on the iPhone 12 (in a dark room) I noticed that the pixels are not completely off, but are a kind of "hazy gray".  

However, when the brightness is raised to at least 35%, the pixels are really dull on black, as long as no actions are performed.  
In fact, when you start interacting with the screen again (by scrolling for example) the off pixels become active again and if you stop again they turn off.  
It is as if the system activates them during interactions, even though a completely black image is represented.  

Have you noticed this too?  
To do a test you can search, for example, on Google Oled black test and being in a fairly dark environment.  
Another way is to watch the screen while the iPhone is turning off (after the Slide to power off). 

All this does not make me think of a hardware problem, because the screen is actually able to turn off completely (offering the classic perfect blacks of OLED screens) but it is as if iOS did not turn them off at 100%, but at 90%.

*All of this is not easy to notice, but because this is my first OLED Im just curious.

Can anyone confirm if apple magsafe cases make it possible to attach phone to aftermarket magnet mounts without the need for additional metal plates? 

\- I have tested just Iphone 12 by itself and it does attach to the magnet, but i would say its 40-50% of the grip that the metal plate has. So i wouldnt risk it on the dash. 

Interested in the silicone apple case but only if it you can use it with out the additional metal plates. 

Thanks,

I recently switched over to iPhone from Samsung and absolutely love it, however, I really miss having an LED notification light. The flash doesn't count and it's not the same thing. With an LED notification light, you don't need to physically turn your screen on to check whether you have a notification - the light does that for you e.g. red light = missed call, yellow light = snapchat notification, green light = sms, blue light = email etc. I NEED something like this on my iPhone. It's a simple feature but so useful. Is there any app out there that does something similar? Is there anyway someone can make an app to replicate this in iOS (it can be similar to the red/orange dot apple shows for mic or camera usage).

I think it's from call forwarding on settings(please see screenshot on the comment). but the problem is that the call forwarding is buffering all the time. NOW WHAT TO DO. Any help?

Hey, has anyone done a trade in at the apple store to get the bonus $150 MasterCard gift card offer from T-Mobile/Sprint listed all over the apple online store.

I would like to purchase a new iPhone 12 directly from my local Apple store cuz they are in stock. What confuses me is the carrier discount thing, looks like if I buy a iPhone 12 from T-mobile, I would only pay $799, instead of $829. The catch is that the $799 pricing requires activation. How much does activation cost with T-mobile? I thought if I buy unlocked phones I could just swap the SIM and start using....

Lastly, if I buy it for $799 from T-mobile, am I required to maintain my t-mobile plan?

Thanks in advance

Howdy,

Well, I received my new iPhone 12 today, and I went from excited to totally pissed in less than an hour.  Everything is transferring from my iPhone 8, with the exception of the login and password information for all of my apps.  I've tried restoring from iCloud, from an encrypted back-up on my PC, etc.  I've reset the phone several times and started from scratch.  Nothing.  

Every trouble-shooting recommendation I have seen references a "Website &amp; App Passwords" selection in settings, but it doesn't exist on either of my phones.  When I go into the regular "Passwords" setting, none of the apps are listed, so I can't even use Airdrop.

I'm 20 minutes from pitching this damn thing in the canal.  Why does it have to be so difficult???  Any clues or tips would be most appreciated.

I'm looking at finally making the big switch from my Samsung S10! 

I am on a bill pay plan so they are offering the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro, although I don't know which to buy!

The iPhone 12 64gb is 49
The 12 Pro 128gb is 449

Do I really need to pay an extra 400 for just minor differences and a higher quality build? I'd also appreciate if you would be able to give me some opinions on colour choice.

I ordered the 12 pro on the 16th and right now I have the iphone 11 pro max but I was going to upgrade for the camera and slightly smaller screen but since it hasn't shipped yet I decided to cancel my order and just wait for next year's iphones. The 12 design is definitely another reason why I was going to upgrade, the iphone 5 design was my favorite but I felt it wasn't worth it from my 11 pro max. Did I make a good decision in y'all opinion and did anyone else decide to keep or get the iphone 11 pro max?

Anyone else notice this? 

I compared it to my iPhone XR and every app shows larger fonts on the iPhone 12 Pro (less on the screen, fewer words per line)

I checked the system fonts settings and both were set to default. I tried making it smaller on the iPhone 12 Pro but most apps dont use dynamic fonts. (IMGUR, Apollo, Google)

I checked the screen size (not resolution) and they are both basically the same at 6.1 inches. 

So why does the iPhone 12 Pro noticeably show larger fonts in every app than the iPhone XR?

So just recently I upgraded to the iPhone 12 from an iPhone 8. 

At first I thought that upgrading to the 12 pro (even as a passionate phone photographer) wouldnt be worth it since the difference seemed to be so minute. 

However, I came to realise that the difference in the camera is actually quite significant in the the long run. I havent yet opened my iPhone 12 so I could still send it back for a full refund... should I bother?

This was briefly brought up before, but didn't get much traction so I figured I would try again. I'm pretty positive it is not my home internet, but I have to switch WiFi on/off in order to get data. Sometimes it works totally fine, but other times websites/IG/YT/FB, etc just hangs and it requires a click toggle to get things moving again.

Anybody else dealing with similar WiFi issues?

Has anyone encountered the same issue? 

Ive happily pre-ordered an iPhone12 but not able to receive it even been waiting all day four days in a row. 

I missed the UPS first attempt to my home address due to I was not home. In order to secure it, I went online to UPS MY CHOICE and changed it to ship to the most close UPS Access Point so someone at the store would definitely get it for me, and that I thought I shall be able to get the package with my state ID. However, thats a terrible start! On the UPS tracking page, the UPS made two attempts to the UPS Access Point, but unable to deliver to the Access Point. I thought maybe thats because the Access Point was closed early because of the COVID time? Called on Saturday to the Access point store. They told me they are open all day and no UPS came to the store and usually they dont get UPS deliveries on Weekends. Okay, that makes sense. I waited until Monday, same record appears on the UPS Tracking  Unable to delivery to the UPS Access Point. Will make another attempt the next business day. Why is it this time? I called the Access Point store again, they told me UPS made many deliveries today except for Apple products and seems the UPS folks don't drop an iPhone package without the receivers signature. Then why does UPS even try to re-deliver to them the second business day? Since there is no option to deliver to my home address on the UPS My Choice page, I called UPS and Apple on Saturday and Monday none stop but not much they can do. UPS says someone from the local patch would call me which never happened all these days. The Apple customer service has only two options: 1. To have the UPS hub to hold on to it (meaning I have to travel to the unsafe neighborhood); or. Change the address but it will take place days later by which the package might be sent back to the sender. 


I plan that I have to go in person tomorrow by Uber to the only UPS customer services center which is 40 minutes away by car which Uber picks-ups takes 20 more minutes ( in an unsafe neighborhood). This is a ridiculous experience and super disappointing! 

I wont place my Apple order again from Apple online. If I need to buy an Apple product again, I would make sure to order it from the carriers store to be safe.

I am upgrading from my iPhone 8 Plus to a 12 (it should actually be here tomorrow) and I have been debating on if I should really get a screen protector this year, or if it is even needed.

I had one on my iPhone 8 Plus for about a year and a half and today I finally took it off (my phone feels really weird with out it on) but I noticed that their are so many more scratches than I first thought in those short few months I had with out one on.  

Just wondering if this year its really needed and what you all are going to be doing. And uh just in case some recommendations for screen protectors. ( I got a cheap ONN branded on just to tide me over until I find a better one just in case)

Hello, everyone! I bought iPhone 12 days ago and noticed that in the heavier games (such as Call of Duty and Dead by Daylight) performance is falling rather quickly. I would like to point this out because on my previous iPhone 11 these same games were quite good, while on this new iPhone there are delays. I would add that, after a while, slowdowns disappear, as if it were stabilised, but when we start another match, we are starting to start again. 
Has anyone noticed this behavior?

12 pro might have a better camera, better speed ... whatever. Those things are marginally better and dont matter to me. 

For a guy that carries a phone in pocket all day, WEIGHT is what matters to me. 

Thats why Ive used a SE. And sometimes used an android S10 plus. It has a monster screen but is very light. 

The iPhone 12 is considerably lighter than that 11 and its the best feature IMHO.

I was hoping somebody could explain or for me in to the direction of the article explaining the difference between Dolby Vision and regular, as well as how to activate or disable activate on the iPhone 12.
Its also my understanding that the iPhone 12 non-pro version is capable of shooting 4K 60 FPS But has a software limit. 95 Mac is reporting the iPhone 12 is capable of even higher FPS in the 120s and above but that has yet to be confirmed.
I guess what Im asking for is to know how to turn on HDR video on the non-pro and if theres currently a jailbreak to allow 60 FPS on the 12 non-pro

Does anyone know when they'll add unlocked iPhone 12s to amazon, or when they added them last year? Because i'm living in a country where there are no apple stores, but I can get them off verified apple resellers for $200 more.

**Hey all,**

Im about to buy one of the new iphones but currently torn between waiting for the iphone 12 pro max or just going for the iphone 12 Pro.

Ive got an iphone 7 and have had it for 3 years, had an iphone 5 for 4 years before that so always had smaller phones.

Ive got pretty small hands, im just wondering if iphone 12 pro max is just not suitable unless you have bigger hands?

I know this will probably come down to preference and i DO want the pro max more as it has a better battery, little bit of a better camera and it would be a plus that there is more screen size and also i plan to keep this phone for years.

Its just the phone being to big hand in hand im thinking and wondering about so if anyone could give some input on how much of an issue the bigger phone is for someone with smaller hands id really appreciate it!

(Where i live in wales were currently on lockdown so cant actually go out and test out the 11 pro max in store or anything and i know my bet bet with all this is just to wait until pro max 12 comes out and then test it in hand but im just a little impatient at the moment as i realllllly want one of these phones asap)

&amp;#x200B;

I know my question is regarding iphone 12 and not iphone 11, but seen as you guys are going to be the ones to have experiences using a pro max in hand, thought you'd be the best bet.

Apple has already moved their Macs to USB-C. And some of their iPads are also USB-C. There's a chance the iPhone 12 could be the last Lightning phone ever.

Im getting the regular 12 from an LCD phone and Im excited but have a few concerns regarding the new display particularly eye strain and potential burn in issues. Ive used a pixel 3 in the past and it occasionally caused me a little bit of eye strain on low brightness. Thats the only experience I have with OLED displays and I figured the new 12 would potentially use a higher quality display than my old pixel. Tell me about your experiences. Are you guys liking the displays of the 12 and are they causing headaches? Also from anyone coming from an older OLED iPhone did you suffer from burn in or anything like that?

I have an iPhone 12 Pro and for some reason, the blacks seem to be jumping back and forth between true black (with the pixels off) and this weird dark gray crystal pattern. Its hard to notice unless youre in a very dark room, but its obvious if youre looking for it.

For instance, when I open Settings in Dark Mode, the top of the screen is very dark gray for a few seconds and the notch is still visible. It looks like the LCD on an iPhone XR or 11. Then, after 3 or 4 seconds, the screen goes back to normal and the pixels shut off.

Why is this? Any fixes you guys know of?

I have always used a Mob Armor car mount which is a magnet that requires a metal plate to be mounted to the back of the phone case.

I have ordered an iPhone 12 through a carrier here in Sweden expecting to arrive in about a week. This subreddit is filled with people saying their phone is defective like battery issues or a yellow tinted screen, my current phone is an iPhone X and the screen has a slight yellow tint to it but it never really bothered me, Is it really that significant on the iPhone 12? Im honestly thinking of cancelling my order based on what I have read.

Hey guys, this is for anyone who is in the fence about upgrading. Im coming from 1 year with the 11 pro which was to that point the best phone Id ever used. My main criticisms with the 11 pro were the phone's weight and difficulty to use with one hand. I could have opted for the mini but it didnt feel like the correct choice. I use my phone A LOT!

Here are my initial reactions to the 12 pro:

Battery is worse, in 1.5 hrs of continuous use Im losing 25-30%. My normal apps running are Spotify, podcasts, browsing online and Instagram.

Experience with screen is way better(reading text, browsing internet etc) Im not  sure what theyve done here but its very noticeable and Im enjoying my time more.

Phone seems both harder to grip and easier at the same time, hard to explain. I dont want to use a case this time around to keep it thinner and lighter. The  weight feels the same but more evenly spread if that make sense. I usually balance the phone on my bottom pinky and it seems less taxing  now. Personally I wish the phone was around 2.50-2.60 inch side to side  but thats just me.

CPU speed I dont feel a difference. Camera quality I see a noticeable improvement  in most shots but Ive had a few come out weirdly grainy.

The final thing is Ive noticed this phone runs hot. Ive read this is normal for the first week which is weird but if it continues I will be returning.

Overall I would say if you can deal with the battery life its a slight upgrade- I sold my 11 pro for $700 so it didnt break the bank for me.  If youve got a really tight budget, wait it out.

Thats all for now! I will answer any questions you have, thanks!

I got my shiny new iPhone 12 Pro on Friday, after being a Samsung Galaxy girl for the last several years. So far Im loving the new phone but Im having an issue I hope someone can help with. I like to set different text tones for my most important people. I managed to bring my fave custom tones over from my S10+ using GarageBand, and all is well...except for one contact. Its driving me crazy. No matter what I try, the text tone for this one particular person always reverts to my default tone. Does anyone out there have any idea why this might be happening? Its driving me insane.

As mentioned, its the 12 vs 12 Pro for me, Im in Canada so the price difference is about 300 CA$ for me (128GB &amp; Apple Care on both). From my research, the extra 2 GB of RAM is for the camera and additional sensors and also adversely affects the 12 Pros battery. However, will it help future proof the phone from ios updates in the future (I plan to use the phone for 3 years and when I updated my iPhone 8 to iOS 13 the phones battery got absolutely ruined)

[Photo of my 12P and 6S](https://i.imgur.com/wtz4Wk2.jpg). Sorry for the quality, but you can still kinda see that its different on the 12. 

Itll pretty sure it isnt just a different shade of white - because it looks significantly whiter and brighter than other stuff on the screen that also are pure white.

Im planning on ordering the iPhone 12 pro max, and am conflicted about what case to go with. Im coming from an iPhone XS Max.

Ive used and loved the Apple leather cases, but they arent very durable, and a bit expensive.
I picked up an Apple silicone case, and love the amount of protection it provides, but I cant stand the buttons... they arent very clicky, especially not compared to the leather cases.

My criteria is that I want a thin case, that provides a basic level of impact protection. I usually run with tempered glass screen protectors, and I want the case to have a small lip above the screen for protection. I prefer the buttons being covered, but want the buttons to be as clicky as possible (like with the Apple leather case).

The leather cases dont hold up to falls very well, and the silicone ones grab onto my pockets a tad too much, and I dont like the button feel at all. Any advice?

Tempted by Spigen. Dont care much about MagSafe for now. In my head the Apple leather case made out of TPU with the same metal buttons would be perfect. I like the idea of the Pitaka cases, but prefer the buttons to be covered...

New iPhone was working great until today. The battery was draining quickly and the iPhone was really hot.  It went from 79 percent to 19 percent in about 2 hours for no reason. The worst part was when I went to charge it and left it charging for 20-30 mins and it didnt charge the phone at all. I used my old 18W charger from my previous iPhone 11 as well so its not like it was the charger at all. I called customer support and now I have to return it and reorder again but the phone is back ordered so who knows when Ill get the new one ugh

I got my iPhone 12 Pro yesterday and I was so excited about it, but the screen looked off. It was considerably worse than my iPhone X screen even though it was supposed to be the Super Retina XDR or whatever. 

I didnt think much of it until today when I saw another post on here about some defective screens on new iPhones, so I talked to Apple Support and they decided the best option would be for me to return it and do an exchange. 

So now the wait begins again, and Im praying that this time I get a good model.

Overall with light usage, Ive gone down from 100 to 64% with only 2h15m screen on time.

I cannot figure out why but all of my apps and screens, like the settings screen and safari, are slightly larger on the iPhone 12 than my iPhone 11. No settings are different between the phones as I restored from backup to the new one.

Just be aware that if you ordered a new iPhone and youre hoping to transfer your eSim from your old iPhone to new one its not supported on EE in the UK. I ended up having to call them to order a new one. 5-7 days delivery... however they do tend to come in 48 hours.

So, my iPhone 12 pro Graphite wasnt suppose to be here until October 30th. I hadnt even gotten a shipping or tracking number yet. So I called my local Verizon and they had a 128 GB Graphite iPhone 12 Pro in stock so I canceled my order and bought that one instead so I got my iPhone 12 Pro today, instead of having to wait another week or who knows maybe longer! I must say I LOVE IT!!!

Ok...I currently have an iPhone8...I am trying to decide between a 12 or a mini. Both have a larger screen than the 8.  Ill buy a 12 this weekend if I can figure out if it will fit in my back pocket!  The iPhone X and 11s seemed so big!

Anyone have thoughts?  Can anyone compare the 8 and the 12 in a jeans pocket?  I dont need pics...this isnt THAT kind of thread

Hi,

I'm new to this as I've never traded in a phone before. My fiance has Sprint and I wanted to get her an iPhone 12. Can I trade in the iPhone 7 for some sort of discount on the 12? Its been well protected inside an otterbox for years.

Hi All,

Got the mrs a iPhone 12 today, noticed a couple of times after its been asleep for a while, waking the device is showing that wifi is connected but there is no data transmitted to or from the device until we toggle wifi off/on in settings or control center.

I have noticed that in my routers App there is no up or down traffic going to the phone, even though we are trying to load a webpage or app.

Wifi network is AX and has been working frine with our 11 and 11 Pros as well as multiple Macbooks and iPads we have in the house.

Anyone experiencing anything similar today?

Like so many others my phone sat in Alaska for multiple days until yesterday.  It arrived in the main UPS hub 70 miles from my home yesterday at 6 pm.  But for some reason it did not move on to the local hub early thimorning and therefore is unlikely to be delivered today.  Unless by some magic it missed getting scanned and is actually out for delivery.  Probably not.

I am trying to preorder the new apple iphone 12 pro but I can't decide between getting the phone through apple or tmobile

the deal seems to be the same except that tmobile is offering up to $500 for my phone + $200 but i have to be on a payment plan

apple is the additional $150 for me being a tmobile customer but I was thinking of doing the upgrade program

I can't decide which is better

I am tempted to go without a case when my iPhone comes in. I will use a screen protector because I use the type where I can literally not tell it's there but I've always used cases and they take away from the experience. Apparently this phone will be much more durable? I'm glad the edges are like the iPhone 5 because I can actually hold onto that. 

The only thing tempting me to use a case is I usually use a case with a kick stand on it so I can watch a YouTube video with the phone on a table sideways.

According to this battery test, the iPhone 12 has much worse battery life than the 11 pro (1 hour+) and he did the test without 5g. Why would Apple do this? Why not just leave the phone a little thicker instead of shrinking the battery?

Im upgrading from an X to a 12 Pro. I honestly hate cases; I just love the feeling of a nice piece of hardware that was engineered with integrity (mostly, even if some of Apples decisions are wack). I dont drop my phones, but I do keep them in my pockets and stuff and they somehow get scratched a lot. Im new to screen protectors, and Im looking for a really nice glass one that isnt too expensive and that I can buy multiple of if one gets dinged up.

I am now using Samsung S10+ and already getting used to its slightly big size. I'm planning to move to iPhone and still deciding whether to buy the 12 Pro or 12 Pro Max. However  I don't know whether the big screen size will be comfortable for me or will I be getting used to it. (Since my S10+ screen size is 6.4" but the 12 Pro Max has 6.7" screen)

 Which one should I choose: the regular sized iPhone 12 Pro or the bigger battery capacity iPhone 12 Pro Max? 20 hrs video vs. 17 hrs video is quite a big difference, I think?

Also, for you who use 11 Pro Max, how do you feel? Are you getting used to it?

I dont upgrade often. Been debating since July cause my 8 was buggy. Going back and fourth between the 11 pro and se2. Now with se1 in the meantime. Cant decide between the 12 mini or just 12 or 12 pro. I can attempt to go to a store tomorrow and pick one up or order and estimated delivery date is around the same time the 12 mini will be out. Not sure what to do ugh. Thats why I dont upgrade often cause I am so indecisive. Any suggestions?

Im set on the 12 mini. So very set. Absolutely firmly set. 

And yet...Best Buy has the blue iPhone 12 in the capacity I want...available for store pickup tomorrow. 

Theyre genuinely six blocks away from my apartment complex. I can run over during my lunch break and pick it up. 

Im having a VERY difficult time staying strong in the face of such temptation, folks! I know I can wait three weeks, but...well...

This is harder than I thought to resist, and Im absolutely kicking myself for even checking the stock status. 

Help! Serious and non-serious responses welcomed! Mockery is appreciated as long as its funny!

According to tomguides Battery test the Standard 12 lasts 10:23.
The IPhone X (my current Phone) lasts 10:49 on the same test.
How is this possible? The iPhone 12 has a slightly bigger battery and a way more efficient chip.
Very disappointed bc I mainly did the upgrade for better battery life.

Edit: According to Apples webpage the 12 lasts 4 hours more when watching videos, who should I trust more ?

Hello - 

I have enjoyed my Note10+ quite a bit I accidently dropped and cracked my screen though and when I went to file an insurance claim they informed me they no longer carry Note10+'s and they'd offer me a buyout on the phone of $1200. 

So here I am now needing to go buy a new phone, the Note 20 Ultra was the most obvious upgrade for me but I also am kind of considering switching things up a bit and considering the iPhone again (Had iPhone 10 previously, but upgraded that to the NOte10+). 

Could anyone provide me with some insight into the following questions to make my decision easier please?

How does Apple Car Play stack up vs Android Auto? 

Would you recommend just waiting for the Pro Max? 

I watch a lot of YouTube (premium) and Twitch on my Note10+ and they are both supported by PiP (Picture in Picture) I know of years past the iPhone hasn't allowed users to do either of those hoping maybe it's changed? 

Otherwise what other justifications / features are there for making the change?

So as the title says I've been with Samsung (Android) since the Galaxy S2. I like it, its great but lately Samsung has been annoying me more and more F.E. Samsung seem to want to stick adds in almost every living default app going, they are also now charging top money for missing features and a plastic back (Note 20) and to top it off in Europe we never get the snapdragon variants. We also appear to have issues that Apple never have (compatability etc)

Initally I will be honest, I was aganst the "cult of Apple" but the more I looked into the ecosytem and how well things just work and their stance on security and well just performance of their own silicon I am very tempted to jump ship over to an phone 12. (I also think perhaps their jump to ARM in the future Macbooks has the potential to be massive)...

So yeah, this was a sorta rant about Android/Samsung and just looking for general input about swapping over?

Is there any gotchas I need to mindful of making the switch?

Thanks!

Gonna be getting an iPhone 12 Pro soon and was looking at wanna get a clear case so I can show off that gorgeous new Pacific Blue colour. I know Apple ones are the best when it comes to MagSafe compatibility but they really dont do much in the way of protection so Id rather just have a normal wireless charger and normal wired charger if it means being able to get a more protective case but I am interested to know how well MagSafe works through third-party cases that arent designed for it. Anyway let me know which you think is the best option below.

I debated a 12 pro max right up until the orders went live but ultimately decided one handed use was the most important thing. Having to juggle a baby and coffee and whatever else on top of the phone made the decision for me. However i just received a pro max case in the mail accidentally and can tell the flat edges make a huge difference. Its much more grippable than previous plus/max phones.

My 12 pro just shipped this morning, can I bring it in to exchange it easily without it becoming a huge ordeal if I did month to month payment with the Verizon option through apples site?

Because of MagSafe I am totally confused about which case to get for the iPhone 12... 

I absolutely LOVE my Mous Limitless 2.0 on my XS and was going to get the Limitless 3.0. BUT then came the MagSafe feature and I would hate not being able to use future MagSafe accessories. I know the charger will work but mounts, wallets etc will not. 

I have pre-ordered the Otterbox Symmetry Series Plus MagSafe compatible case in black but I am very unsure about it. I highly doubt that it has as good of drop protection as the Mous cases and the plastic back looks so cheap in comparison. Have any of you used the Symmetry as well as the Mous? 

The Apple Silicone case looks slim and all but it's silicone... And I guess the drop protection is very limited. 

What to do? Go for a MagSafe compatible case to make sure you get full compatability for future MagSafe accessories or get the Mous Limitless 3.0 and be limited to their magnetic accessories?

Hey i have a 11 pro max and I normally get a new iPhone each year and sell the previous one works out not that expensive if you have the money to buy them upfront.

This year i was gonna go for the standard size and I dont think the pro model is worth the extra now the only real difference seems to be the cameras.

Other than the camera is the normal 12 a downgrade to my 11 pro max or is it still an upgrade in terms of everything else.

Im not really into photography and i can count the number of times i used the ultrawide on my 11 pro max on one hand.

If your preorder is already in transit (say, for delivery on Oct 23rd) then you can track the phone early pretty easily.

* Visit [this site](https://www.villagedrapes.com/html/tracking.html) (going through UPS's site directly didn't work for me - had to use this as a workaround)
* Enter EITHER your cell phone # OR your Order # (which you can find in the Apple Store App) as the reference number. Important - if you're using the Order #, don't enter the last two digits.
* Enter your zip code
* Track!

You'll see the current status and will also receive your tracking number for easier lookups going forward.

Hi guys!

I currently own a Samsung Galaxy S9 but I will soon switch to the new iphone 12 pro (in graphite). However, I still can't decide if I need the one with 128gb or 256gb of memory.

In my current device I am using 61gb/64bg. I have around 3.500 photos, 200 short videos, maybe 30 apps, and a few games stored in my phone, but I had to delete a lot of stuff to stay under that 64gb limit.

Sould I get 128gb or 256gb of memory?
Do you think upgrading from 128gb to 256gb of memory is worth 100$ ?
How much memory did you personally chose?

Has anyone received the green iPhone 12? How does it look like in real life? Is it more subtle/more saturated than photos?

I love the green, its gorgeous. But I plan to use my phone for at least 4 years and I get sick of colours easily. My issue with the green is that a lot of case designs dont go along with it as well as it does with the white. So I guess it depends on how strong the green comes off.

I've ordered the 12 Pro which arrives on Friday, but after seeing reviews on the battery life and the camera having a larger sensor on the Max model, is anyone else tempted to get the Pro Max instead?

The one and only thing that puts me off the Max is the weight, everything else seems spot on.

Thanks

is the iPhone 12 Pro really worth the extra money?
the 128 GB iPhone 12 is $849
the 128 GB iPhone 12 Pro is $999
both have 6.1-inch OLED display and the A14 chip
the pro even weighs more 189 grams vs 164 grams

This is my first iPhone purchase so I'm wondering if the sim card comes in the box. I ordered from the apple site. I chose the tmobile version but I opted out of activating online and chose the activate later option. I tried a couple google searches but came to nothing. One result said new iPhones come with the sim but it was from 2012 so don't know if that's reliable. All the unboxing videos don't mention anything relating to sim cards either. Can anyone shed some light here?

Hello, 

I think by the end of the year I'll take the plunge and get a new iPhone: 12/12 Pro or 12 Pro Max. My choice is not yet finalized. Awaiting tests and taking them in hand. 

My question is very simple: Do you have any recommendations for shells with a good protection/appeal ratio? Phones are more and more beautiful and thin, it's a shame to hide them inside a huge brick.  

Knowing that for several years, a shell has been adapting and renewing itself on the next model as soon as it is released, I think we have a good sample at the moment. 

For my 4S, I had a bumper. For my 5S, 6S+ and X, I had turned to Spigen. This year, I don't know. 

Which hull to favor? Which material? Apple's are very beautiful but very expensive and what I hear is not very durable. Some of them made of silicone seem thin, but I'm afraid that in the pockets, silicone will catch various stuffed animals. Anyway, did you find your model? 

Thank you.

Im a photographer and filmmaker and love using iPhones in many situations that larger equipment simply cant work in. 

I currently have the iPhone 11 in green, it was a major upgrade over my 8 and came in my fave colour which is mint But unfortunately as time went on I regretted it as I cheaped out on a LCD screen and missing telephoto. I sorta wish Id bought the pro tbh. 

Then the iPhone 12s with ProRaw and Dolby vision was like huge for me, in fact Id consider this as a secondary camera for photography and film on the go just because of those! 

So Ive been tempted to upgrade for the OLED screen, ProRaw, Dolby Vision recording, and added telephoto 

But torn over whether I should get the pro or pro max. Its just so much more expensive but gives a larger sensor. Should I put more money into that? Im not a huge fan of giant phones but larger sensor  would that even be worth the higher price? 

Is Worth it even though its still just a phone?

I was really excited about the blue since I love how it shows up on the site, but the leaked photos are disappointing. Anyone else wanting to return it? If so are you sticking with the 12 or getting a different model? I love how the Pros look too but didn't really want to spend the extra 100 on it. Now I'm seeing the colour and how popular they are I'm thinking I might bite the bullet and get Pacific blue or graphite.

Hello everyone,

I know that this is the question of the moment, and that in a way, it is impossible to have a clear answer until the different models have been tested. Nevertheless, I take the risk of asking it to potentially know which model I should move towards according to my needs (or even if the change is really this year).

I have been an iPhone X owner since Christmas 2017. In the past, since I joined Apple, I have had a 4S, 5S and 6S+. Originally, I changed every 2 years. With the X model, I could easily wait 3 years (Having given my old models to family, I confirm that they all still work).

I am very satisfied with the iPhone X: When I bought it, in my opinion, it was the perfect size. A few years later, I wouldn't mind a slightly larger screen. Since a few weeks, I noticed some latencies on the model, nothing insurmountable, but at times, you can feel it pedaling in the semolina. Concerning the battery, it says "Repair" (Is it worrying?) with a maximum capacity of 84%. That's for the report.

Concerning my use, in addition to having a classic use of my phone (Certainly more advanced than the normal. Indeed, I tend to do everything on my phone. I take out my computer in case of last resort. Indeed, I really use my computer in a different setting knowing that this means I am at my desk. Where the phone is my daily life no matter where I am), I have a video business where I run a YouTube channel. So, all my videos are filmed with my iPhone and the excellent "Filmic Pro" application. All the writing of notes and feeding of social networks is also done with my phone.

So I write my videos on my iPhone, then I have them on my iPad, I film with my iPhone and the video editing is done on my MacBook Pro 16 inch 2019.

So much for the need. Now the question is this: Is it relevant to consider a change of model? If so, which one to turn to?

The 12 Pro seems to have bad echoes as the differences seem minor compared to the 12. The 12 Pro Max seems very good from a specific point of view, but is very expensive and considering its size, I have serious doubts about whether it is viable (even if for having taken over the 11 Pro Max, the model itself does not seem so "imposing"). Especially since if the phone is bigger, it requires the change of accessories (especially the car holder).

What's your opinion on this ? Of course, all this will require confirmation once the models are released.

A few subsidiary questions:

\- At the end of 2020, at what price will you resell an iPhone X? 

\- There is no charger in the box. I have an Aukey 60W charger. Could it do the job with these new models? Or should I get another wall charger? Indeed, the paradox is the following: These chargers are made for quick charging. However, it seems to me that fast charging is bad for the battery. Isn't this the case?

\- A milestone seemed to have been passed with the iPhone X, but nowadays, the phones in this new range, even with advanced use, have a better longevity, don't they? 

Thank you in advance for all your answers.

Hello, 

My question is simple: Are Apple's "Max" models too big to be viable for everyday use? 

Indeed, considering my needs and these incredible specificities, I seriously ask myself the question to acquire the iPhone 12 Pro Max. I have already taken the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Compared to my iPhone X, the difference does not seem monumental (less than between a 5S and 6S+). Nevertheless, it's impossible to know if size is a daily problem. Do you have any feedback to give me about your experience? 

Do the advantages in photos, videos, and especially in visual comfort make you forget the size of the phone? 

I'm not used to writing a message with one hand, even with the X, and I have difficulty getting it to fit in my pocket. At this level, it won't change me. But it's clear that with a Pro Max, when you take your phone out, it's much less discreet. 

What do you think about it?

I just got notification that my next payment will be charged on Oct 20 for last years IUP purchase even though I have been approved for and will receive upgrade to 12 Pro on Oct 23.  Since I got my phone last year on day one, I along with many others get to pay two extra payments. I know thats in the agreement but it still hurts.  On a side note,  I find it ironic that the Apple Store app starts showing You are eligible for an upgrade after 12 payments an upgraded phone has even been announced.  I guess technically a move to a 512 gb 11 Pro Max would have been upgrade to my 256 gb model.

Is there a significant difference between the 12 and 12 pro camera when it comes to low light situations. I have very poor lighting at my house and barely any natural light. I currently have the 8plus, so when I take pictures/video of my drawings and artwork I get a lot of noise/static(?) in the picture. If there is a huge difference in the cameras I'd consider the price jump between the two.

I currently have a 11 Pro Max. I love it but thinking of downgrading in size for better form factor, one hand usage, etc. I do love a big screen though. So not sure. Im on AUP and dont mind upgrading. That blue and style are calling my name! I'm obviously hoping for 120hz next year so I'll most LIKELY upgrade next year but you never know. So I want to make a good decision regardless. I feel at this point Ive gotten use to the bigger size but I dunno. The 6.1 is intriguing to me. I keep ping-ponging back and forth on which one I want. Im literally 50/50.

Apple is recommending its new 20w adapter for the magsafe charger.  But I already have three Apple 18w adapters (one came with the 11 pro max, another with 11" iPad pro, and I bought an extra for travel and taking into work when that was a thing).  Is there a rule of thumb for how much slower charging will be with magsafe charger + 18w adapter vs the 20w adapter?  Would it only be 10% slower?  Or is it more complicated?  It is nice that USB-C is becoming more ubiquitous but there always appears to be complications or was that only in the early days of the standard (eg issues with Nintendo Switch and third party chargers)?  If uncertainty leads one to keep buying the latest and greatest adapters then any benefit to the environment from not including adapters in the box with new phones etc goes away.

Ive had the iPhone 7 since 2016. It was going strong until I shattered my screen... so, I am now in the market for a new phone!

I am stuck between the iPhone 12 Mini and the iPhone 12 Pro. Looks like the Mini will be closest in size to what Im used to, though part of me wonders what it would be like having a larger phone.

I do have very small hands, and I cannot reach the other side of my phone with just one of them. But, since thats the case, I might as well get a larger phone entirely?

I also thoroughly enjoy taking photos. My phone operates more as a camera than a phone, so Im very excited for the photo quality upgrade.

What would you all recommend? iPhone 12 Mini or iPhone 12 Pro?

Hey guys -

I got my iPhone 12 preordered and I'm looking for a case for it. I'm looking for a specific kind of clear case - a black border / bumper type thing with a clear back. I basically am looking for a case closest to  the Spigen Ultra Hybrid, but the buttons on the Spigen Ultra Hybrid for this year are a strange square shape that doesn't match the phone.

I was just wondering if anyone had any recommendations for cases? I'm looking for something with decent drop protection that isn't too expensive. I don't like completely clear cases due to the yellowing that  takes place over time and I just don't like the aesthetic of it. I really like that black border thing. Basically, the Ultra Hybrid would be perfect otherwise, but I really don't know if the buttons will be  nice. I prefer them to match the phone and have tactile response - clicky.

I've looked at the Unicorn Beetle Style and that looks kinda nice, but not a huge fan of the grey  borders. I also looked at the Cyrill Color Brick, but I'm not a huge fan of the translucent backing. Those two are probably the closest I've gotten to what I want...

Any help would be appreciated, thanks!

Hello everyone,

I'm a long time android fan and this year I've been considering more and more about switching to the iPhone.


Currently I'm using the Galaxy S9. Since I live in Europe, most Samsung phones come with the Exynos chipsets which are crap when compared to  Snapdragon variants in the US. I'm honestly fed up with the need of worrying how my device is going to perform, and after the Apple event I'm 99% sure that my next purchase will be an iPhone.


Before I make that a 100%, I have a couple of questions:

- Is the iPhone 12 worth buying or should I stick to the last years versions? I've read about the smaller battery sizes in the newer generations, and also there is questionable battery consumption when using 5g.


- since this will me my first purchase, I do not have any iPhone chargers or accessories. Will that be a problem?


- I recently got a Samsung Active S2 smart watch. How is iPhone handling non-Apple gadgets? 


- Is there anything else I should know about iOS? Do I still need iTunes for transferring images, music etc? I also remember that on my wife's iPad there were some junk files such as leftover app data which were eating up the free space and the only way to free up the space is by resetting it. Is that still a thing?


Appreciate the help, and excuse me for any errors - I'm typing this on mobile.

I want a big screen &amp; good battery life, but the 12 pro's starting GB is 128 which is good bc if I were to go for the 11, I'd have to pay extra for the 256GB. I know the 12 is a good phone, but should I sacrifice a bigger screen for more storage? please give me your opinion &amp; advice. Also, the reason I'm not getting the 12 pro max is bc it's way too big for me.

I tried posting this on the iPhone subreddit, but its got deleted.

My main question is I was denied due to "APPLICANT'S IDENTITY CANNOT BE VERIFIED". Now Citizen One/Bank said usually its not a vague message like that, So he sent it to be manually reviewed. Who then called me and said to check with Equifax, To see if anything was not right on their end. Which after confirming all my details. They said its all correct and confirmed everything. They said they didn't even see the soft check by Citizen One/Bank. Which strike me as odd. I called Citizen One back again, who told me to try again if what Equifax said was true. Which he said if I get denied, its should tell me the issue, and if I don't get approved. Then check [Apple.com](https://Apple.com) for other options on getting the phone you want, or check with your carrier. Well I got denied AGAIN for the SAME REASON. Citizen One is giving me vague answers on this now. As the last rep stated, Well you were told to check other options. So I said what? I want to know what I can do to get approved. Your not stating my CS as the reason, I don't have any negatives on my reports etc... So telling me to check with T-Mobile isn't a valid option here. So how can I fix this? She said let me see if someone higher up, can answer it for you. So I should be getting a call back.

So, What can I do in this situation?

Anyone else gone with white for the iPhone 12? I like colors but plan to keep this phone 3 years. I will use a Apple case for work but I feel the colors will get boring after a while like I change my Apple Watch band every 2 days or so.

The white seems classy and reminds me of the classic iPhone 4s 5s look.

Anyone else?

There has been a lot of back and forth arguments about which iPhone worth buying as the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro are almost identical. There is plenty of people who dont like bigger phones like the iPhone 12 Max, and rather prefer a medium-size displays (6.1 inch), so... Opinions??

It was extremely smart of apple to say that the 12 is based on the design of the 5 because if you think about it, the wordplay there says it all...we give you a new phone with a throwback body, but thats it. Let be honest if this was truly an IPhone 5 made modern the camera bump would be nonexistent. Am I wrong here? Lets chat

I like photography. However I rarely take night photos. Granted a larger camera sensor is always nice but is it so much better in daylight shots to see a difference from the regular pro? Like is the high dynamic range going to be better with the larger sensor or will it not be noticeable? 

Worth going from around $45 Apple upgrade program to $58 a month AUP?

 I want to get a iPhone 12 from Verizon. One of their protection plans is $6.85 month. But, includes unlimited screen replacement at $29 a pop. And, " Nextday replacement for lost, stolen or damaged devices " This seems a better and cheaper alternative than Applecare+ and Applecare+ with Theft/Loss. Or am I reading it wrong what do you guys think? I want to preorder tonight.

I'm currently a Samsung Galaxy Note 9 user and I'm trying to understand iPhone users' opinion/perspectives. Currently, there is no real reason to get a new phone, as my Note 9 still works very well like when I first got it. One of the main reasons for me to consider transitioning to iPhone 12 is that Note 9 will receive one more feature update and 2 more years of quarterly security updates. And without feature updates, the phone loses value/appeal. On the other hand I know that iPhone consistently receive prompt updates for about 5 to 6 years, which makes the phone keep its value for longer period.

For historical reference, I previously have used...

* Nokia/MS Windows Phones (I liked the concept of the OS, too bad no 3rd parties really supported)
* Apple iPhone 7 Plus (didn't like decentralized/vendor/shoddy Android updates - poses security risk)
* Samsung Galaxy Note 8 (didn't like little to no customization on iOS - Samsung Galaxy phones was best Android option - good balance in security + feature)
* Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (dropped Note 8 and got it replaced)

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my thoughts on my current Note 9:

Personally, I don't think I gain/lose anything on camera side. I'm not a professional photo/videographer and Note 9 does its job well enough for me to be happy. I do love taking family photos. And I'm sure Note 20 Ultra and iPhone 20/Pro/Pro Max cameras are much nicer, but I'm not quite sure if it's that much better than Note 9.

Note 9 battery performance is still good. At the end of the day, I still have about 30-40% battery remaining. I know A13 is very battery efficient and I expect that A14 will be even better, but at the moment not a huge concern as I don't mind charging over night

Stylus is great and I know that's something I won't have if I get iPhone 12. The features that Note stylus adds to the phone is quite unbeatable. Few things I love about Stylus:

* take picture remotely
* take notes on the fly without having to open apps
* ability to be more creative taking notes/drawing/mind mapping
* when precision is needed (vs fingertip)

Speaker sound quality is good. It works and sounds great. No complain here.

Expandable storage is another point that I think is unbeatable. My Note 9 comes with 128 GB internal storage, and I have added 128 GB SD card as well. I don't need anymore storage at the moment, as all my files are backed up to the cloud, but I do love the fact that storage space will never be any issue.

Screen - I like the size, but I don't like the curved screen. At first it felt great, but when it comes to actual functionality, it is a bit annoying.

Apps - I do have a hefty list of apps I use on my phone (work, fun, hobby, emergency, etc). I'm unsure whether all the same apps are available. But I know that the main apps I use on Note 9 are available on iPhone.

Samsung Pay is actually great. While there is Android/Google Pay and Apply Pay, Samsung Pay can be used at most credit card machine with its patent MST technology.

USB-C is great. I have a lot of other USB-C devices so I don't have to worry about finding cables to connect Note 9. I'm not sure the idea behind Apple to keep lightning port, but it would be another cable I have to worry about. 

Android customization is great. I know iOS came a long way, and at the moment I can't say whether either one is better or worse than the other.

I dislike the idea of decentralized OS, due to the fact that Samsung comes with it's variation of Android, all of the patching and feature updates takes longer. Android 11 was release recently, and even though Note 9 is fully capable of running it, it won't receive the update. And as mentioned before iPhone gets updates for 5 to 6 years which is really awesome.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? As an iPhone owner, would you recommend me to move towards iPhone 12 or Note 20 Ultra, or stick with Note 9 until I really need to get a new device?

I know it's the color that most people are going to get, but I actually find it pretty boring and quite ugly... it's just not nice in my opinion... I think the midnight green was so much better, I think they made a mistake by going with pacific blue and killing the midnight green, I would have rather had a Midnight green iPhone 12 Pro or even a dark glossy Jet Black iPhone 12 Pro... but the blue just looking boring to me.

Question on the Verizon promo thats up on Apple.com - I normally pay for my phone in full upfront but my current phone is the X so its been a few years.

Basically if you choose the Monthly Payments under the Verizon Upgrade Program, you receive an instant credit and then you receive an additional credit after 1-2 billing cycles after trading in the phone. So for trading in my iPhone X it results in $440 in credits. Monthly payments for the entry iPhone 12 Pro would go from $41.62 per month to $31.62 (before credits applied) and then $23.29 per month after trade-in.

HOWEVER - It mentions in the fine print that Customer must remain in the Verizon Device Payment Program for 24 months to receive the full benefit of the Verizon bill credits.

Three questions:

1) If I wanted to pay off my phone in full, based on the above, am I not able to take advantage of that additional credit as it seems like those need to be carried across the full 24 month period? 

2) Next year if I wanted to get the iPhone 13 or whatever new phone is launched next year, do I lose out on those additional credits as well?

3) Also for next upgrade, can I order via Apple or do I need to I need to go through Verizon? Since the Verizon monthly plan is listed an option on Apple.com now (not sure if it was there before) then it seems like I could? Id prefer to buy through Apple if possible.

TL:DR: Should I buy my phone in full or is this promo worth it? I have the money to pay upfront but this is effectively almost 50% off the total cost of the phone, but this deal seems too good to be true.

I have the 64 gb X. Im at 63.7 gb (mostly photos, videos, and texts). I would have gotten 128 gb since I always start new but this year Im trading in my phone and will be starting my phone from iCloud backup. If I want my phone to last me another 3 years: 128 or 256?

Fun question: what color are you buying? Im between graphite grey and pacific blue (I always get a space gray iPhone). Im not a fan of gold. This year, the silver caught my eye too, but Im going for either grey or blue!

I really could care less about the camera on the 12 Pro but I may have to buy it. The average brightness on the 12 is 625 nits vs 800 nits on the 12 Pro. 

While both have a max brightness of 1200 nits thats irrelevant. The average brightness is what you look at all day when the brightness is set to AUTO. 

Im wondering if 22% more brightness is worth $200?

I currently am very happy with my 11 Pro. What I love most about it is the camera quality and the stainless steel. That being said, I am considering upgrading to the 12 Pro, but had some qualms. 

I initially got the 11 Pro instead of the 11 mainly because it was smaller. Im pretty sure the 12 Pro is the same size as the 11, so there's one thing im not excited about. Everything else about it though is \*chefs kiss\*. 

Now would going to the 12 or even the 12 mini be considered a downgrade? Like I said I always prefer the smaller of the models they release. But the camera quality isnt as good and I do love the stainless steel on my current model. Not sure what to do. Lots of pros and cons to figure out but I would appreciate any help with the decision making! I think at this time Im gonna have to wait until I can see them in person to make a choice no matter what.

Hi Reddudes and Reddettes

I'm stuck between choosing between the two.

**iPhone 12 Pro in Gold**

I really *REEAAAAAAALY* want this because of the gold color and because it's stainless steel. I want to flex on those who don't have this one.

**But the iPhone 12 Mini**

I really **REALLY** want this one because it'll save me from having arthritis and it's just so convenient to have a phone that isn't too big. I have the OG iPhone SE and I love how I have flexible finger reach. But, it doesn't come in that juicy, tasty stainless steel gold.

Help me choose before midnight comes:(

Hey everyone. Im super indecisive so Im looking for some guidance. I have a red XR now and I love it but Im thinking about upgrading. The better camera is very appealing. Im a student so I work almost all day, and a lot of that is on my phone so Im wondering if the Pro Max would be worth the extra money for the increased screen size. The phone itself wont be too much bigger since the iPhone 12s have a much better screen-to-body ratio. Or will it still be too bulky? Im a female but I dont have particularly small hands or pockets. Also wondering about the availability of cases in stores, I dont have a lot of options near me already and its almost impossible to find an XR case locally. 

Im also wondering about the color. I love the product red line but unfortunately its not available in the Pro. Im stuck between the silver and gold. I have a case on my phone at all times anyways, but I do prefer clear cases so I care a little.

I guess mainly based on previous exprience with previous Apple product releases with pre-orders, has anyone received a device on the day of release?

I have always bought direct from Apple, and what has always happened is they've been shipped well ahead of release day from China, and I end up receiving them 2-4 days after release date.

I'm thinking of different online retailers this time to 'beat the round the world trip' ordering directly from the Apple online store.

I don't want to spend a lot of money, money is tight for me right now and I can't spend $1000 on a phone again, and the price tag on the 12 Mini is in my budget but im not sure if that would even be an upgrade.

I couldn't find this on the Apple website, but I was wondering if you can turn the 5G capabilities on and off depending on your preference. I am not a conspiracy theorist, but I just did a quick google scholar search and noticed that most of the research done on the impact of radio frequencies on the body/brain (human and animal studies) seem to have been conducted in the 500 MHz - 3 GHz range (mostly 900 MHz) which show mixed results. The new mmWave band in the iPhone 12 is much higher than this (in the 27-28 GHz range), but I couldn't find a lot of research using these higher ranges (please send articles if you have them as I didn't spend that much time researching this yet). I figured since the research on this does not seem to have been conducted extensively, it would be nice to know you can turn the 5G off if evidence comes out that these wavelengths may be harmful in any way.   Anyways, sorry for the long question, any input would be greatly appreciated :) [**https://doi.org/10.1002/bem.22052**](https://doi.org/10.1002/bem.22052) [**https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16091607**](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16091607)

Sorry to rant, but is it just me but the iPhone 12 seems like hype. I mean a smaller notch would have been nice and a fingerprint reader would be ideal as my iPhone 11 has no idea who I am when I put a face mask on. Instead we have 5G, not available anywhere near me, and faster processing to watch 4K movies and pictures on a screen that seems to be already great. OK, I am a curmudgeon.

I was expecting to possibly opt for the 12 Pro Max but on looking at it's physical dimensions it's slightly too big. It's longer than my 8 Plus, and I have found it as large as I would want a phone to be.

I wondered what peoples opinions are as to whether the standard 12 or 12 Pro would feel 'smaller' than my 8 Plus in terms of screen and usage? Obviously there's far less bezel, but it is a longer narrower screen.

I watched the Apple event (Oct. 13, 2020) and was comparing the different models. One question that popped into my mind was that if iPhone 12 Pro is really worth the extra $200 compared to the regular iPhone 12.

I wrote about my take on it here if you like to read more: [https://medium.com/@divaaan/is-iphone-12-really-worth-it-12bfd653848](https://medium.com/@divaaan/is-iphone-12-really-worth-it-12bfd653848)

Looking to but iPhone 12 Pro.. when is the preorder for it starting????
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-10-14
Im into photography and the telephoto lens on the 11 Pro is a big bonus since I enjoy clicking close-ups. 
However, the standard 12 has Smart HDR3 + enhanced Deep Fusion + enhanced night mode across all cameras, including the new 7-element lens, in short, BETTER computational photography. 

Im in a serious dilemma and unable to decide.  Should I go for a discounted 11 Pro or should I buy the standard 12 that offers better computational photography overall? Its true that the 12 has the latest internals, but Im more concerned about the photography experience.

The 12 Pro is $1635 in my region (by conversion), so its totally out of question. 

Im currently using a XR and its still in mint condition. 

Kindly help!

iPhone 12 pro's slo mo capabilities are no better than the three year old iPhone X. Shouldn't the vast improvements in processing power allow for higher frame rates?

I purchased an iPhone 11 Pro Max a month ago and I fully paid it off. Do you guys think itll be worth buying a 12 Pro Max? Or whats your opinion?
-------------------------------

Is the only difference between the two, some camera abilities? Or is there more?
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-10-13
So i just compared the speccs of those to and apparently the  diffrence is the extra camera with lidar, materials and brighter screen+better video. Did i forgot something?(Colour)

If your just a casual user of the Camera does the 12pro make anysense? With 128gb its a diffrence of 200 bucks.

Worth it?

So I have an iPhone 7 Plus, which is marvelous and has been for the past quite a few years. Still works perfectly. Cameras are both 12mp and compared to the iPhone 11 Pro max, they take similar photos. I think it may be time for an upgrade so I was eagerly awaiting the unveil of the new iPhone. Yes, even though the iPhone 4/5 was my favorite design, nothing stands out to me with the new phone, especially for the money. Not anything that's worthwhile for me at least. My biggest use of a phone would be the cameras. ( turns out with regular daylight photos the 7 plus beats most of its successors) . Now I'm thinking of switching over to the Samsung family, specifically the Note 20 Ultra which is cheaper now ( than the iPhone 12 pro max) thanks to Prime Day. Thoughts?
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-10-13
Personally Im incredibly disappointed. It feels like a regression for Apple. I shouldnt be shocked, it was bound to happen, but disappointed that they didnt innovate more. 

Im always one of the first to upgrade when a new IPhone comes out (always go with the highest spec/ largest screen) but Ive decided Im just gonna stick with my 11 Pro Mac for this year. Seems like it would be a huge waste of money to switch it up this year. 

What are yalls thoughts? Anyone have a real argument for the upgrade?
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-10-13
I thought of purchasing iPhone 12 (or maybe mini as the device form factor is really good), but going to skip because the models lack higher refresh rate screen. 

The absence of higher refresh rate in this time when almost all the flagship smartphone have it, is not justified. 

I thought maybe iPhone 12 will come with 90Hz and Pro models will come with 120Hz refresh rate but.

Maybe iPhone 13 will have it next year. My iPhone 7 is still good for causal gaming and daily stuff. Saving money for next gen.
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-10-13
curious. might buy 12 if it does.

Apple after 3 years nothing changed. We hope you work with LG to make a self lit OLED panel for the future, that does not use any PWM or any flickering trick! I cannot buy any new iPhone because of that Flickering on the oled display! And mini led, if you are planning to, will not fix it, since IPS display still has an higher PWM rate. Please use self lit panels from new LG tv!

I am so happy that the flat edges of the old iphone design has made a comeback. My current phone is the original iphone SE. ive used iphone 6s/6s+ and 7/7+ but the rounded edges felt less grippable imo.

also i am torn between the mini and the 6.1... halp
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-10-13
Now that iPhone 12 has been announced today, in terms of price is it worth it to get 12 pro max or 11 pro max? Both 256GB.
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-10-13
Who else feels that the pricing could have been a lot better if they kept it around 60K?
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-10-13
Price of unlocked iPhone 12 is $829 and not $799.  
Same with iPhone 12 mini, unlocked version comes at $729 and not $699.

Also, apple will not be offering charging brick and earphones with iPhone 11 and iPhone XR.  
This is the reason apple has reduced price to $599 and $499 respectively.

im really torn between the iphone 12 pro &amp; the pro max. i originally was set on the pro max, but when they announced it would be 6.7 inches i hesitated bc thats too big for me, i have small hands. on one hand i think that a 6.1 inch screen is too small for a pro model, but its still a good phone &amp; will have most of the features of the pro max. i have no idea which way to go.

Ive always bought phones from the store on launch day instead of online. In COVID world, thinking of going the online route instead. For those of you with experience ordering the day ordering opens, do you generally get the phone by launch day? Or do the orders get backed up after the first minute theyre online and youre stuck waiting weeks? 

TLDR is it likely to get the phone right away when ordering as soon as it opens or do the orders get backed up right away?

Right now the trade in value for the base iPhone X is $280 on Apple. Will this go up, down, or stay the same with the iPhone 12 release?
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-09-29
Anyone else wondering about the size of the notch, or just me? It seemed like there was precisely *one* rumor saying that it was going to stay the same size, and then nothing else was said about it. 

Lately, all of the leaks have been about everything BUT the notch.

Hi! I need a new iphone but seen as iphone 12 is around the corner i may as well wait, the only thing that puts me off the iphone 12 is the 5G function, i don't want to use it. (I KNOW debatable but thats for another time, please people..)

On my iphone 7 i know i can select just 3g, will this function be on the iphone 12 where i can select 4g or 3g and ONLY use them and the iphone 12 will NOT try to connect to 5G ever even if there is a connection available and near for 5g?

also saw this article by apple: [https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT203124](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT203124)

If I get the new iphone 12 i will probably be with a new network provider, does the network provider also have anything to do with if you connect ot 5g or not?

I live in the uk and there is 5g posts near me.

Thanks all!

Hello everyone! Ive decided to buy the iPhone 12 Pro whenever it releases but I am very confused on what the camera layout will look like??? Half the time on leak videos it seems to be symmetrical with 4 circles but half of the other time it looks like the 3 camera layout from the iphone 11 pro but with an ugly lidar beneath one of them. Can someone please send a photo of what the finalized camera layout will look like on the iphone 12 pro? Thank you!

I signed up for the iPhone upgrade program last September- 
If I am right in thinking  you upgrade on the 12th month and then subsequently hand the device back to Apple, then swap devices for the newest version. 

But my question is what/how would the potential delay with the future iPhone devices affect the upgrade program as surely if the device is delayed by lets say (November) then when you hand the device back to Apple you would be loosing money as youd have paid more. x2 more payments so then would it be better to just sell the device privately and pay remainder of the contract off. Then open a new upgrade program on the new device. 

As on my iPhone 11 Pro Max from September there would be around 700 ish left on the remaining balance but in November there would then be around 550 left so I would essentially be loosing money once the device is handed back to Apple over selling it privately. 

Or would Apple give a store credit to the value of the delayed months ( I realize that this is a pipe dream )

I am so sick of this space gray bullshit, its too light. I upgrade every year and I always get the dark iPhones, I had the black iPhone 5 which was a beautiful dark and the Jet black iPhone 7 which looked amazing. I wish Apple would bring back the jet black color for the iPhone 12 Pro models... I am sick of this space gray, its just so boring looking. Nothing beats a full on dark black.

I have been thinking about this lately. I have an iPhone XR right now and Im planning on upgrading to a 12 when they come out. I heard there is going to be a 5.4 inch version and i would love that, I miss smaller phones so much. Im not a fan of big phones and even my XR is a little too big for me (I have tiny hands). Do you think that would be a downgrade? I dont want people to think Im poor if they see me with a small phone but I prefer it.

I heard that since the Mitch would be smaller and thinner bezels will make them slightly smaller. Not sure by how much.
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-08-11
I mean arent they going to be almost exactly the same? They will both have OLED, they will both have 5G, the bezels on the regular iPhone 12 will be the same as the 12 pro. Right now the regular 11 and the 11 pro are very different, making the 11 pro feel pro. But what would be the point if they are the same? I think Apple should just go back to making two iPhones, the iPhone 12 and the iPhone 12 Max and drop the pro name. Or maybe even go back to Plus instead of Max. iPhone 12 Plus sounds like a great name to me. What do you think?
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-08-11
In my opinion, these should be the color options:
Matte Black
Glossy Jet Black
Silver
Gold
Rose Gold
Navy Blue.
The Jet Black coming back would be amazing for those of us who prefer glossy to matte (like myself). What do you think? I think space gray needs to be killed. A dark black would be so much nicer.

At this point, I have personally seen/heard so many damn rumors about the 2020 and 2021 IPhones that I dont even know what to believe anymore! 

So far this is what I have been hearing: 

2020: 4 IPhone 12 models (as we already are aware) 

2021: now this is where it gets crazy..... 

IPhone SE Plus

IPhone 13 leaks and potential port less device(s) 

AND now a Rumored IPhone 12e (which I doubt would be a thing but it keeps popping up on YouTube and Twitter soooo ) 


I mean, I cant be the only hope be seeing this all the time! Anyone else? 


What are we actually hoping to see in 2020 and 2021? I have my ideas that Ill share in comments below  lets chat friends

Pretty simple.

Looking to convert from a Note 8 to iPhone.

Main reason for the debate on the 11 vs 12 is the 5g capability the 12 would have and the 11 wouldn't.

Does 5g matter that much to wait?

Hi guys,
So I'm starting to see on some websites that the 5,4' iPhone 12 will have a disgusting LCD panel.
The only reason I'm interested in the iPhone 12, it's because of the small size AND oled panel.

Hi! So, I am confused as to if I should aim at getting the 12 or wait it out &amp; get 13 in 2021. Since, Apple is know to change its designs every 3 years. (You know how 6-7-8 can fall in one bracket &amp; the X-11-(probably)12) 

Background: I use a perfectly working 7 &amp; am a student so the cash crunch is real.

We have about 3 damn cameras and no super zoom is yet to be seen anywhere. Majorly disappointed so far and I doubt this will change
